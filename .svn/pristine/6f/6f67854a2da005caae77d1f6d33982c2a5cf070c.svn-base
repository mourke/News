You can certainly reinvest profits from an S-corporation into the business or pay out profits from a C-corporation as dividends, but the incentives go different ways.  S-corp earnings are taxed as ordinary income (none of the double-taxation of corporate profits) and S-corps can't give out different classes of shares, so there's an incentive to distribute the profits out to the shareholders.  C-corp earnings are taxed once at the corporate level and then once as dividend earnings, yet they can have multiple classes of shareholders.  The incentive is to build up the business and eventually seek an IPO, acquisition, or other liquidity event.\r\n\r\nIt almost looks like James is positioning HotOrNot to get big and get bought.", "id": 398, "time": 1172093867, "type": "comment", "by": "nostrademons"}

That is, if you yourself can't stop using it regardless of who else is using it, it is a stronger product.  del.icio.us is like that- I started using it because it was a nice central place to store bookmarks regardless of who else was using it.  It was only later that I started noticing how many others were bookmarking and even started using it as a search engine.  Flickr- same thing.  Youtube & myspace- still kind of the same- say I was the first user of youtube, I may still like it so that I can put my videos in one place and shoot off an email to my buddies to go have a look.  The point is the tool better be compelling without a community or you'll never be able to grow a community.

Not having expectations of growing a startup to Facebook, Google or Bebo size you are going to be wasting a VC's time. This is no mean feat - you have to be mentally prepared to grow and scale a company like mad and similarly your startup must have proved its case for being able to scale.<p>Whats the best way to know if your startup is ready? build a prototype, get some traction, look at the numbers, measure, experiment then measure again. If you truly are going to scale (and you are growing at 1% a day) and you've experimented enough that you've found a suitable path you'll end up needing money of the VC scale.<p>It doesn't cost much to sit around and build something. Go and test it - figure out what people want first - change your assumptions and above all PROVE that if you scaled your site it'd be worth it for investors. You don't need VC yet to start something and test it out - If it comes to that point well thats something to think about.<p>I'm reminded of the story Michael Birch of Bebo tells - they built something, put it out there off the traffic of birthday alarm and experimented with features. Every time a feature added to the growth of the site and got a noticeable increase in users they kept it and tried something else which also contributed to the growth. By experimenting, measuring and then iterating for things which correlated for growth they ended up on the right path. When they had 5 million users and were growing month on month they had the numbers to prove themselves. They took $15m from Benchmark capital.

I could see something like Hotmail or Skype being bootstrapped with this method, because those services are useful to both individuals and businesses. Back then, email from any PC with the internet or free international voice calls would have been things that many businesses would have paid for (and still would, if there weren't so many free alternatives now). Even Reddit got its NYT deal soon after starting which pushed it into the black, did it not? (not rhetorical - I don't know much about their history so tell me if I'm wrong!)<p>There is the problem of loss of focus though. If a company like Hotmail started in '95, realised it could make millions selling their product to companies and focused on that (sales, turnkey servers for easy installation), they would probably only get a few years of that income at most before they are dethroned by a company that just focused on making the best web based email possible. So it would be a bit of a local maxmimum. Is this more dangerous than the loss of focus of doing something totally unhelpful/unrelated to the main product to bring in some cash (contracting, searching for investors) while simultaneously working on the final product?

{"parent": 1043, "text": "Since the NYT demands your info:<p>THE World Wide Web is awash in digital video, but too often we can\u0092t find the videos we want or browse for what we might like.<p>That\u0092s a loss, because if we could search for Internet videos, they might become the content of a global television station, just as the Web\u0092s hypertext, once it was organized and tamed by search, became the stuff of a universal library.<p>What we need, says Suranga Chandratillake, a co-founder of Blinkx, a start-up in San Francisco, is a remote control for the Web\u0092s videos, a kind of electronic TV Guide. He\u0092s got just the thing.<p>Videos have multiplied on social networks like YouTube and MySpace as well as on news and entertainment sites because of the emergence of video-sharing, user-generated video, free digital storage and broadband and Wi-Fi networks.<p>Today, owing to the proliferation of large video files, video accounts for more than 60 percent of the traffic on the Internet, according to CacheLogic, a company in Cambridge, England, that sells \u0093media delivery systems\u0094 to Internet service providers. \u0093I imagine that within two years it will be 98 percent,\u0094 says Hui Zhang, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.<p>But search engines \u0097 like Google \u0097 that were developed during the first, text-based era of the Web do a poor job of searching through this rising sea of video. That\u0092s because they don\u0092t search the videos themselves, but rather things associated with them, including the text of a Web page, the \u0093metadata\u0094 that computers use to display or understand pages (like keywords or the semantic tags that describe different content), video-file suffixes (like .mpeg or .avi), or captions or subtitles.<p>None of these methods are very satisfactory. Many Internet videos have little or obscure text, and clips often have no or misleading metadata. Modern video players do not reveal video-file suffixes, and captions and subtitles imperfectly capture the spoken words in a video.<p>The difficulties of knowing which videos are where challenge the growth of Internet video. \u0093If there are going to be hundreds of millions of hours of video content online,\u0094 Mr. Chandratillake said, \u0093we need to have an efficient, scalable way to search through it.\u0094<p>Mr. Chandratillake\u0092s history is unusual for Silicon Valley. He was born in Sri Lanka in 1977 and divided his childhood among England and various countries in South Asia where his father, a professor of nuclear chemistry, worked. Then he studied distributed processing at Kings College, Cambridge, before becoming the chief technology officer of Autonomy, a company that specializes in something called \u0093meaning-based computing.\u0094 This background possibly suggested an original approach to search when he founded Blinkx in 2004.<p>Mr. Chandratillake\u0092s solution does not reject any existing video search methods, but supplements them by transcribing the words uttered in a video, and searching them. This is an achievement: effective speech recognition is a \u0093nontrivial problem,\u0094 in the language of computer scientists.<p>Blinkx\u0092s speech-recognition technology employs neural networks and machine learning using \u0093hidden Markov models,\u0094 a method of statistical analysis in which the hidden characteristics of a thing are guessed from what is known.<p>Mr. Chandratillake calls this method \u0093contextual search,\u0094 and he says it works so well because the meanings of the sounds of speech are unclear when considered by themselves. \u0093Consider the phrase \u0091recognize speech,\u0092 \u0094 he wrote in an e-mail message. \u0093Its phonemes (\u0091rek-un-nise-peach\u0092) are incredibly similar to those contained in the phrase \u0091wreck a nice beach.\u0092 Our systems use our knowledge of which words typically appear in which contexts and everything we know about a given clip to improve our ability to guess what each phoneme actually means.\u0094<p>While neural networks and machine learning are not new, their application to video search is unique to Blinkx, and very clever.<p>How good is blinkx search? When you visit blinkx.com, the first thing you see is the \u0093video wall,\u0094 25 small, shimmering tiles, each displaying a popular video clip, indexed that hour. (The wall provides a powerful sense of the collective mind of our popular culture.)<p>To experiment, I typed in the phrase \u0093Chronic \u0097 WHAT \u0097 cles of Narnia,\u0094 the shout-out in the \u0093Saturday Night Live\u0094 digital short called \u0093Lazy Sunday,\u0094 a rap parody of two New York slackers. I wanted a phrase that a Web surfer would know more readily than the real title of a video. I also knew that \u0093Lazy Sunday,\u0094 for all its cultish fame, would be hard to find: NBC Universal had freely released the rap parody on the Internet after broadcasting it in December 2005, but last month the company insisted that YouTube pull it.<p>Nonetheless, Blinkx found eight instances of \u0093Lazy Sunday\u0094 when I tried it last week. By contrast, Google Video found none. Typing \u0093Lazy Sunday\u0094 into the keyword search box on Google\u0092s home page produced hundreds of results \u0097 but many were commentaries about the video, and many had nothing to do with \u0093Saturday Night Live.\u0094<p>Blinkx, which has raised more than $12.5 million from angel investors, earns money by licensing its technology to other sites. Although Blinkx has more than 80 such partners, including Microsoft, Playboy, Reuters and MTV, it rarely discloses the terms of its deals. Mr. Chandratillake said some licensees pay Blilnkx directly while others share revenue and some do both. Blinkx has revealed the details of one deal: ITN, a British news broadcaster, will share the revenue generated by advertising inserted in its videos.<p>For all of Blinkx\u0092s level coolness, there are at least three obvious obstacles to the company\u0092s success.<p>First, because Google Video is not much good now doesn\u0092t mean it won\u0092t get better: after all, when Blinkx was founded, it first applied machine learning to searching the desktops of personal computers, a project that was abandoned when Google and Microsoft released their own desktop search bars.<p>Second, even if Google improbably fails to develop effective video search, the field will still be crowded: TruVeo, Flurl, ClipBlast and other start-ups are all at work on different subsets of the market.<p>Finally, Blinkx might not go far enough in searching the content of videos: the company searches their sounds, but not their images.<p>THIS last objection is the most serious.<p>\u0093Because Blinkx emphasizes speech recognition, there is a great amount of multimedia content that they cannot address, like photographs,\u0094 said John R. Smith, a senior manager in the intelligent information management department of I.B.M.\u0092s T. J. Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, N.Y. \u0093But what\u0092s worse, speech is not a very good indicator of what\u0092s being shown in a video.\u0094<p>Mr. Smith says he has been working on an experimental video search engine called Marvel, which also uses machine learning but organizes visual information as well as speech.<p>Still, at least for now, Blinkx leads video search: it searches more than seven million hours of video and is the largest repository of digital video on the Web.<p>\u0093Search is our navigation, our interface to the Internet,\u0094 said John Battelle, chief of Federated Media Publishing and author of \u0093The Search,\u0094 an account of the rise of Google. With Blinkx, we may have such an interface for digital video, and be a little closer to Mr. Chandratillake\u0092s vision of a universal remote control.<p>Jason Pontin is the editor in chief and publisher of Technology Review, a magazine and Web site owned by M.I.T.

In Erlang&#39;s concurrency model it simply runs 20 (or so, I think- anyway some static number) functions and then goes to another process.<p>Because the functions are, uh, functional there is almost no state to save and restore when there is a context switch.

{"kids": [1325], "parent": 1178, "text": "I&#39;m not convinced there is much use for this. And there are two fundamental problems.<p>The first problem is the institutional structure of the US education system. In my experience, tech-savvy instructors rarely look for a generic CMS solution. And those without much tech experience resist change unless it is forced upon them because they are already good at what they do and change disrupts their ability to get their jobs done. Blackboard gets around this inertia by selling to university and school administrations, which then push the technology out throughout campuses. It is a top-down sales regime. The company has non-compete clauses so that instructors cannot adopt other systems even if they wanted to. Competing with Blackboard on their own terms would mean wining and dining a lot of administrators who are not going to be interested in beta-testing software.<p>The second problem is more fundamental. A lot of the really interesting stuff happening in the education field is happening with interest based communities like Chinesepod or even open source software projects (for an education in programming...). There are two things that are common to both sorts of communities: #1 they are interest driven, #2 the materials produced are not attempts to solve specific institutional needs so much as address individual &#34;learner&#34; problems. <p>A project like this should be very clear about whether it is serving institutional or learner needs. If you don&#39;t know exactly how to help students, what is the point of creating a system simply to automate stuff?", "id": 1317, "time": 1172554993, "type": "comment", "by": "trevelyan"}

They&#39;ve won the war as far as universities are concerned.  However, universities generally do the job of teaching very well.  You also don&#39;t hear of fatal university shootings often (If ever?  I haven&#39;t looked.)  I&#39;m in it to improve the lives and education of high school students.  If I manage to better just one student&#39;s life, then I&#39;ll consider it mission accomplished.<p>High schools are very much open game.  They&#39;re open game because they can&#39;t typically afford the huge sums of money that universities can.  I plan to dominate the low end by creating a product that&#39;s simple, efficient, and inexpensive; something that every teacher would want.  I&#39;m not competing with Blackboard.  I&#39;m sidestepping them.<p>I agree that teachers have methods that they&#39;ve employed for years to teach students.  But part of that is exactly the problem.  When something is done exactly the same for years on end, it gets stale.  A teacher would have -fun- with my product, exploring other&#39;s ideas and communities.  I plan to make them happy.<p>They may be reluctant to use my product, but I plan to be with my two cofounders, on foot, visiting local high schools as soon as I have a feature set that&#39;s useful, and spending time with individual teachers to show them how they might benefit from it.  Then it&#39;s up to the teachers whether or not they&#39;ll use Classbug, but if I&#39;ve done my job well, they&#39;ll most certainly want to.<p>Shawn", "id": 1325, "time": 1172562752, "type": "comment", "by": "palish"}

{"kids": [1429, 1432], "parent": 1315, "text": "It&#39;s interesting to look at the differences between the way Dexter&#39;s doing it and the way we do it. Dexter appears to be lifting his foot straight up off the ground and then falling forward to produce the forward motion. <p>The way humans walk is exactly the opposite. The toes are at a different angle from the foot (when walking), so that our feet effectively look something like ___/ , with the underscores being the foot and the / being the toes. We then transition from the ___ part of the foot to the / part of the foot and push forward, and land flat footed with the other foot. For whatever speed you are going, there is a proper ratio between landing on the ___ part of the foot and pushing off the / part of the foot, and that&#39;s where balance comes from. That is, the faster the acceleration of the fall, the faster you transition from ___ to / .<p>So in humans, balance comes from the way one step connects to the next step, whereas Dexter appears to be treating each step as a discrete unit, where it has to attain balance at the end of one step before going on to the next step.<p>If you actually have to balance yourself after each individual step instead of using the next step for balance, the problem seems in some ways to be much harder. <p>Also, the balance problem is greatly compounded by the small steps Dexter takes. Compare this to doing lunges. When you do a lunge, you basically take a long stride forward and then sink into it, all while keeping your torso perfectly upright. This gives you a much bigger platform for stability. As terrain gets steeper, the way humans walk becomes more like a lunge for this reason. <p>So my guess is that taking one tiny step and then balancing is the hardest part of this problem, because you have the least tools at your disposal. For example, you can&#39;t use the next step to balance you. However, once you can do the last step of the sequence, all the preceding steps working backward from the last one get progressively easier.<p>I don&#39;t know anything about robotics, but as an athlete and sports physiology geek I find the problem interesting.

'... here is no equivalent of a model-specific SQL refresh \u0096 something that could drop a specific model\u0092s tables and regenerate the needed SQL automatically ...' ~ true, recognised & being corrected ~ http://www2.jeffcroft.com/blog/2006/jul/20/top-ten-things-suck-about-django. <p>SOME POINTS: Two things come to mind that are not mentioned. The first is hosts. What is the comparison between hosts? The second is how mature the language is. If I want to use python and I need a particular module that does 'fo '. it is probably out there somewhere (though it may be alpha or beta it will most likely out of date) unless you want to re-invent the wheel.  I can't say the same for Rails. Ruby is just a younger language with less code mass.<p>QUESTIONS TO ASK: In the end what really matters is how good the idea & business is. There are plenty of Rail based companies I can think of making a go of it. The same applies to Python based companies.

{"kids": [1582], "parent": 1458, "text": "I'm rusty on my Python, but I'd have to guess that no, Python's dynamic features don't get you the kind of power that Pascal's talking about.  The key thing to realize is that any particular feature that your language has doesn't necessarily matter.  For example, Python may happend to have a built-in way of doing<p>(with-input-file (in \"myfile.txt\")\n  (do-something in))<p>In Python, this might look like<p>withInputFile in \"myfile.txt\":\n doSomething(in)<p>(hey, I told you I was rusty on my Python...especially my totally made up Python!)<p>So maybe the feature came built-in to Python, in which case you're lucky--Guido happened to decide to implement this feature.  But what if he hadn't?  Well, just write your own abstraction.  Obviously, Python can open files and do stuff with the file's contents.  So it seems logical that you should be able to create an abstraction which saves you from writing the same boilerplate that you do every time you open an input file.  Unfortunately, there are some abstractions that *you just can't write* in most languages (including Python).  This file open example is a good one.  Here's another example, in the form of a programming challenge:<p>In Python, create an abstraction called \"debugExpr\" that consumes an expression E, and then does two things:\n  1) prints \"Expression E = V\", where E is the given expression, and V is the value E evaluates to.\n  2) returns the value V.<p>For example,<p>%python% 6 * debugExpr(2+3)<p>Expression 2+3 = 5<p>30<p>I'm betting you can't implement debugExpr in Python.  So assuming Guido didn't extend the language to implement this feature, you're pretty much SOL.  It's a shame because debugExpr, I think, is pretty darn useful.  It means that you can take any expression in your code and \"inspect it\", without worrying about adjusting the structure of your program, and without affecting its semantics.  Without debugExpr, I'd have to change my example code to be something like this to get the same result:<p>print \"Expression 2+3 =\"<p>tmp = 2+3<p>print tmp<p>6 * tmp<p>\nYUCK!\n", "id": 1478, "time": 1172644475, "type": "comment", "by": "vegashacker"}

But the pro's know better and know there is more to it than that. The answer to your question is not as cut and dry as you think.<p>ASSUMPTION?: I'm assuming your product is a shrink wrapped binary to be released to one operating system for single users (from what I've read on your product).<p>COMMUNICATION: I cannot really view your software, but it looks like its a binary application. Unlike its web counterparts, your audience cannot simply use your software. This is by far the biggest hurdle. If your audience cannot use or see your software they will judge (rightly or wrongly) by what information you offer. Do you show on your website, blog or other forms of communication the following?<p>* product summary?: simple sentence explaining problem solved<p>* why better/product comparison: how is your product than competitor(s)?<p>* features: list of things the software does<p>* scenario: small stories of how certain problems are solved<p>* images: screenshots of major forms<p>* blog: meta behind the scene view of product (my favourite as you can really \nguage the product process) & how real users solve their problems (hopefully with your software)?<p>* forums: what problems people are having<p>* price: what is the price of your software? No price, even if its alpha still give a hint <p>DELIVERY: Are you going to have your software on your website? Or are you going to look for the best couple of sites that offer downloads for new & categorised binary software like Tucows or Cnet.com?

From here you can work out important things like pricing, feature matching etc.<p>  '... Your first set of problems revolve more around business & distribution than software and engineering. ...'<p>CONCLUSION: Notice I've not added any development problems here (release planning, defect processes, etc ...)  Your first set of problems revolve more around business & distribution than software and engineering.  Since you have invested time & money and you want to protect your investment consider the following. Go back to marketing 101. <p>Invest the time (not money) to see how you can improve the communication of your product on your site. Then concentrate on placing your product with Cnet. At the same time maintain your job (and income) & improve the existing code but not new features.<p>There are other alternatives, explore those. I do not suggest you open source the product. If you have created a site that communicates the benefits of the product. Found a way to deliver the product to consumers. Then you can work on selling.

{"parent": 484, "text": "It is interesting to point out that Reddit already tried this platform for comments on scientific papers.  arxiv.org has long been acknowledged as a forerunner to scientific e-publishing and is in fact a one-stop-shop for many subfields of physics, computer science, and almost all of mathematics.  We thought it would be the perfect place to try to do something like what you suggested: to use a Reddit-like interface to collect comments and discussions on scientific literature.  So Reddit set it up at arxiv.reddit.org.<p>As you can see, there is not much happening.  In fact, the main lesson learned here was not that a reddit-like platform is not ideal to this type of knowledge pooling, but that the scientific community is in general skeptical about this type of information sharing.  We did not require email address validation for logins (hence the spam you can see up there), but we did talk about it with a lot of people and there were good arguments on both sides.  I talked with physicists, biologists and mathematicians about using this type of site, and the replies were mostly those of insecurity about sharing incomplete ideas: both because they might be wrong (and not many scientists like that), and because if they were right, they would rather keep it to themselves and publish it.<p>Actually Paul Ginsparg, the creator of arxiv.org, kind of warned us before we launched that it would take mostly a huge grass-roots effort to get scientists going on something like this.  He was right, and from listening to some of his stories about how he started arxiv.org, it apparently took him over 5 years of grass-roots convincing before it took off, despite being clearly a very good idea.<p>If you are interested in scientific knowledge sharing, with an eye towards collaboration, check out openwetware.org, which uses the mediawiki wiki platform.  Note that they actually do require account authentication, so have a lot less spam issues at this point.  It seems like a wiki platform is more easily adopted for scientists (although still hesitantly), as the subreddit oww.reddit.com, which we tried to push to the openwetware community, has not taken off (this time because of concerns that Reddit is a company.)", "id": 1980, "time": 1172932580, "type": "comment", "by": "lucks"}

Well we have prototyped the idea and would like to start building it for real, and we kept getting caught by Rails when we tried to go against the grain.<p>So we started to look into other web application frameworks, and turned up a lot of comparison between two python-based frameworks, Django and Turbogears, with Rails.  Although they were all very outdated, they all boiled down to using a python-based framework if you want more of the internals exposed (because you have include a lot more code to explicitly specify what you want to do), and use Rails if you don't want these details exposed.  To be fair, you can always dive into the rails code itself to look at the internals, so it is more of a question of how you want your application code to look.<p>As I don't have too much Turbogears experience at this point, I would gladly welcome a re-analysis of the comparison from someone who does.

AFAIK, DHH did most of the initial programming for 37signals, though they obviously have more now.  Their advice (in \"Getting Real\") was to start with one programmer, one designer, and one person who could do swing work - a little server admin here, a little CSS work there.  This also squares with Fred Brooks's advice in Mythical Man Month - a programming team should be organized like a surgical team, with one lead programmer and 5-7 people running support so he has no distractions.<p>There're some big advantages to this structure, mostly involving communications overhead.  With one programmer, you don't need to coordinate who does what.  You don't need to explain what needs to be done.  You don't waste time fixing broken interfaces.  You can move quickly and add whatever features the customers want.<p>I've worked for two startups that have both suffered by starting with a team of 4-5 (1 founder + 3-4 employees) instead of a single founder.  It's very hard to get everyone on the same page on the requirements, particularly if the employees don't know the domain well.

I've found that it actually lets you have more complex ideas than you would be able to have by starting with an outline (or god forbid just freewriting). The idea is that writing should be about ideas, and words are only there to express your ideas. Because of this it doesn't make sense to start putting pen to paper until you figure out what you believe. And it's a lot easier to figure out what you believe what you can drag and drop pure ideas around instead of mucking around with text. <p>Concept maps are another tool that lets you do this, but since writing is fundamentally either flat or hierarchical in terms of how you express ideas, I think mindmaps work better.

{"parent": 2195, "text": "Nice article Jeremy. My answer though is none of the above.<p>First, most social networks make just as much money off selling data as they do from ads.<p>Second, all the ads you mention fall into the same category. That is, the product being advertised potentially creates value for the user. So basically the user has to click on the link and buy the product.<p>The most profitable advertising is the type where the ad itself creates value for the user, in addition to the product being advertised. For example, music videos on MTV.<p>Unfortunately all of the social networks in existence today are monetized under the traditional model.<p>The startup I'm currently working on (kitchen table phase) is a social networking thing that actually allows users to manipulate advertising spatially in three dimensions. Of course the user's perspective is completely different, all they see is how the website makes their life easier (and gets them laid) and not how its being monetized.

{"parent": 2256, "text": "All these points are vague and non-actionable. Here's my take:<p>If you've been Net Native long enough you probably remember oFoto and Shutterfly and Webshots. What happened to all these sites? Flickr.<p>Flickr was designed around an open API from the ground up, meaning you could take your photos and embed around the web and in other applications. You could even take other people's photos and embed them around the web and in other applications. It was pretty sweet.<p>As a result they quickly dominated the photo sharing scene and were bought out by Yahoo! in record time.<p>Flickr's sustainable competitive advantage was freedom.<p>Back in June the Flickr team was having an internal debate about whether or not to allow competitors to data mine their site. Flickr's founder, Stewart Butterfield, posted a comment on his blog saying, <p>*******<p>\"T]his is something that we've never had any set policy on and this thread has sparked a lot of internal debate on the team: some people felt that it was unreasonable, some people felt like it didn't matter since Flickr should win on the basis of being the best thing out there.<p>I actually had a change of heart and was convinced by Eric's position that we definitely should approve requests from direct competitors as long as they do the same. That means (a) that they need to have a full and complete API and (b) be willing to give us access.<p>The reasoning here is partly just that 'fair's fair' and more subtly, like a GPL license, it enforces user freedom down the chain. I think we'll take this approach (still discussing it internally).\"<p>*******<p>This makes sense for a non-profit like Wikipedia but it was a bad idea in this case. Flickr made their money by tapping the differential in the freedom gradient, so by requiring reciprocal openness they are literally forcing the competition to steal their sustainable advantage.<p>The paradox is they'd be better off just bending over and taking it. That's pretty fucked up.<p>Or, as Thomas Pynchon says, \"If you can get them asking the wrong questions, you don't have to worry about the answers.\"\n", "id": 2258, "time": 1173062653, "type": "comment", "by": "Alex3917"}

If your boss is 50 and the company is sluggish and behind the culture and curve, then it's your boss's disposition that made it so, not his age.  It's a kind of slow culture that anyone turning a profit can get stuck in. ", "id": 2308, "time": 1173084093, "type": "comment", "by": "jwecker"}

They build a database model of how close words relate to each other & use this to compute word combinations. The closer the word combinations, the closer the association.

The core architecture of OpenID makes it possible for users or small groups of users to operate their own OpenID servers, avoiding the need to hand their personal information over to any third party to prove their (pseudonymous) identity.  If it becomes standard practice to filter OpenID requests to only allow authentication from certain large providers, then OpenID becomes no better than any other single-sign-on system.<p>Moreover, there is no advantage to filtering authentication sources.  An OpenID authentication is merely an assertion that the user is authorized to use a given universally unique identifier.  The only way that the authentication source can cheat is by permitting auths that it should deny, or vice versa.  Because users can choose the authentication source they use, there is no incentive for such cheating.  In the case of a private person running their own OpenID server, the only attack would be for that person to attack their own account, nonsensically.<p>If you're unconvinced of the security of permitting anyone to serve, consider the analogy to Jabber servers: anyone can run their own, federating into the wider XMPP network, and the network maintains security because the misbehavior of one server only affects that server's users.", "id": 2747, "time": 1173296924, "type": "comment", "by": "notabel"}

If every dollar bill in everyone's wallet magically turned into two, the price of everything would double and nobody would be materially affected.  Similarly, doubling everyone's karma and causing the up arrow to give two points rather than one would have no material effect.<p>Inflation matters when you factor in time.  Inflation encourages risk.  It makes your current savings become less valuable in the future, encouraging you to try to increase your wealth to compensate.  Too much inflation encourages too much risk, and you get a bubble.<p>Money is valuable because it can be exchanged for scarce resources.  Karma is valuable because it gets you attention, which is a scarce resource.  There are two kinds of attention: visibility of articles and visibility on the leader board.  Karma is the cause of the latter, but only a byproduct of the former.  There are a fixed number of articles on the front page and a fixed number of spots on the leader board, but both become more valuable as the community grows, because more eyeballs means more attention.<p>At this point, the money analogy breaks down.  Money is both a unit of accounting and a medium of exchange.  Karma is only a unit of accounting.  It tells us how wealthy we are, but we can't exchange it for other wealth.  Attention doesn't behave like a commodity either.  If we give and receive the same amount of attention, that's not the same as simply doing nothing.<p>So, news.yc really doesn't behave anything like a conventional economy.

I am now reading \"Demo Day\":\nhttp://mealticket.wordpress.com/2007/02/13/demo-day/<p>\"..when you think of Facebook as being one of the most exciting companies in the Valley right now and then you realize it's being driven by a young team it makes you question a lot of assumptions. So my 'intended' career path had been law - where your pay and rank is determined purely by the number of years you have worked at the firm for. When you hit a certain age maybe you make partner and maybe you don't. But the point is that age and experience rule in that culture and not raw ability. Why do we have to assume that we can measure the ability to perform well purely by the number of years someone has worked in a particular field? Mark Zuckerberg doesn't have 10 years experience of running companies worth $1 billion but he's doing a pretty good job of it so far.<p>\nWhy does someone who has spent 10 years analysing financial markets have a better chance of making a success out of an idea we live and breathe everyday? The attitude in the Valley is that your age is determined by the number of startups you've gone through - there are people here my age who have already started and scrapped a couple of companies.

The author talks about the prestige of programming being low, which in IT it is, but there are obviously coders that have prestige. John Carmack, for one, is very highly regarded in the computer science field, but he never went to a prestigious CS school. What I find interesting is that programmers only get prestige from actually DOING something. This can happen at a big company but more often than not it happens at a startup. Lawyers and Doctors 'get' their prestige from going to school and getting their title, whether it is deserved or not, but programmers have to earn it through solving problems. I find that much more rewarding, it will mean much more for me to be prestigous because of my work than because of where I went to school.

This led to his invitation to join Terman's graduate course on ham radios, which also included Bill and others, who were crucial to starting and building HP.

It provides rules, which say you need to take things down when you're asked, but you're otherwise not culpable- As long as you take it down when asked, you're OK.<p>\nNow, with Youtube, before Google invested anything in it,  Google sees a lawsuit coming which could change that.. They KNOW that youtube is likely to be sued, and don't want to have the judge define the laws in a way which screws them over.. They know this lawsuit is coming one way or another, and that Youtube is poor, so their legal defense is likely to..well..suck.<p>Google realizes that if they buy Youtube, they can use their considerable legal muscle and financial capital to DEFEND youtube, and to make sure that they law isn't redefined in a way that screws them.. <p>Since the US system works by a process of Common Law, the precedent is binding. That means that this case will be VERY influential in dertermining any other cases. And it's THOSE that is worried about.<p>THAT's why Google bought Youtube.

It will never make a difference in what you do, and you'll probably never use it.  However, that remaining 1% can save you *huge* amounts of time or open up massive opportunities.<p>Just a couple examples where procrastination has changed my life.<p>When I was 16, my family went shopping at the Tanger 2 supermall in Riverhead NY.  I hate shopping.  So, I did what I normally do: I found a bookstore, grabbed an interesting book, curled up on the floor, and read half of it by the time my parents got back.  On that particular occasion, the book was \"Learn Java 1.0.2 in 7 days\" or some other tripe like that, the year was 1997, and the Java wave was just taking off.  One book led to a second and third, and then a whole shelf full, and eventually an internship at MITRE corporation.<p>While on the job, I was asked to learn Perl.  A couple years later, immediately after high school graduation, my math teacher's wife was starting a company and had an immediate need for some Perl programming.  In the year I spent at that company, I got to experience a dot-com run exclusively by teenagers, 3 different business plans, all the tribulations of a startup, and eventually an ugly VC takeover.<p>While slacking off at that company because I had no work to do, I found Fanfiction.net and the Harry Potter fandom.  I read a whole bunch of fics, then my workload picked up again and I promply forgot about it.  I went back to it during college, and ended up joining FictionAlley.org, which was just starting at the time.  Over the 4 years that I volunteered for FA, I saw it grow from 2,000 registered users to 100,000 registered users, from one machine to three, had my first experience managing teams of software developers and got to take my first major project from conception to completion.<p>Separate thread - at an internship after my freshman year, I was goofing off at work and reading Ward's Wiki.  I ended up getting pretty involved in housekeeping there after the internship ended, and struck up a few friendships.  One of them led *directly* to the startup I'm currently employed at, via a couple of internships.<p>Now that I'm co-founding a startup of my own, I'm finding that all the different internships and threads and so on pull together.  I know what to expect in terms of growing a community.  I've had experience with 2-3 different technology stacks (and found they all suck ;-), but at least that led me to one I'm reasonably happy with).  I know all about scaling concerns and breaking an app out over multiple boxes.  I've got some experience in judging whether a business model will fly or not.  (I think our business model sucks, BTW, and really doubt it'll get us off the ground, but we've gotta start somewhere.)<p>All of this came, in some way or another, from procrastination.<p>Incidentally, running a startup seems much the same way.  The vast majority of stuff you do is worthless, but the 1% that pays off really pays off big.  Unfortunately, you have no way of knowing what that 1% is until you try it.  People talk about how Bill Gates got lucky with the IBM deal - the thing is, Microsoft had a zillion balls in the air at the time, and if they hadn't gotten lucky with IBM they might very well have gotten lucky elsewhere.", "id": 4244, "time": 1173907581, "type": "comment", "by": "nostrademons"}

Some of the negative points you bring up have a lot of bearing on your lives as founders and probably should be considered.

If you're planning on doing a web startup I'd also recommend it as a team building activity.  The stress is high, the time limiting, and the competition hectic.  You'll find out quickly how well you can work with people in a crunch.

What I find disappointing sometimes is that when this happens there is no way for me respond to them directly about the link (you can send messages to another user, but then you lose a lot of the context). The most obvious answer would be to allow me to comment on other users' bookmarks or \"send\" them a message back about the bookmark they sent me. The explanation I keep getting when I say this is that they didn't want to distract users or muddy the purpose of the app by turning it into another blogging tool. Ultimately, I think they made the right choice not to add this feature. It keeps it clean and useful while still allowing for self expression within the core of the application.

I didn't see an easily-accessible feedback link (note to other startup founders: include this), so I'll post my feedback here:<p>1. Congratulations.  In two days, you have managed to create a community more fucked up than YouTube.<p>2. I started watching <i>because</i> of the outrageous stuff other viewers were doing.  When you go to curb the abuse, be aware of this.  Many of your viewers may be watching only because folks are doing stupid stuff like ordering pizza and making yCombinator pay for it.  Lose the hassles and you may lose the audience.<p>3. Reality TV shows succeed because they're <i>unreal</i>.  TV execs hype up and dramatize all sorts of conflict, because that's what gets viewers to tune in.  Nobody wants to see an ordinary person's life, because it's <i>boring</i>.<p>4. Who do you want to be - Anna Nicole Smith or Paris Hilton.  Your success in attracting viewers is proportional to how trashy you are willing to become.  Anna Nicole Smith and Paris Hilton remain media darlings because we can look at them and think \"Wow, look how pathetic they are.\"  It makes us feel good about ourselves.  Unless you are similarly pathetic, people will not want to look at you.  Respectable people like Tim Berners Lee or Steve Wozniak seldom end up on the news.<p>5. If you <i>are</i> respectable and still choose to go on reality TV, you're setting yourself up to be torn down.  The justin.tv tagline is accurate: \"An exercise in narcissism\".  Narcissism is going to prompt abuse.  People think that since you've set yourself up on a pedestal, you've given them an opening to tear you down.<p>6. I initially had logged in watch the yCombinator dinner.  That proved impractical because of the technology: the audio quality was shitty, the video would randomly drop out, and you couldn't really see anything anyway.  Part of the problem for attracting a decent community is there's nothing for <i>decent</i> people to do.  That leaves it as a festival for troublemakers.<p>7. Have you guys not read Shirky?  Almost all the problems tonight could've been predicted from his articles.  <a href=\"http://shirky.com/.\">http://shirky.com/.</a><p>8. Lose the arrogance.  Kyle was bragging about his 1337 MIT CS skillz in the chatroom.  Emmett was talking about their being only a finite number of attack vectors, and he'd have them all patched in a week.  In my experience, <i>never</i> underestimate the clever things people will do to break your system.  People will still be finding ways to abuse it a year from now, assuming it still exists.  The arrogance is just an invitation for them to try harder.<p>9. I won't be back, mostly because this is a complete waste of time.

The only difference is that with PPC there's a minimum - I think it's 5 cents, though it might have increased to 10 - but you can define an action as an extremely infrequent event. But that difference only comes into play when you've got no competition, and if you've got no competition for a keyword, it's extremely unlikely that it's going to be a lucrative one.<p>The key point is that Google figures out how much it makes by sending people to a site, and ranks the sites based on that metric.

{"parent": 5576, "text": "Dan, thank you for sharing that awesome list. Joel's recommended books are great; in fact, back when I was developing a micro ISV, I used to turn to Joel's website for advice. That is where I discovered Paul Graham's \"Hackers and Painters\". Since then, I have shifted my allegiance to a new mentor :) I think the book brought three major changes in how I think:<p>1. Think big: Since I was developing a micro ISV, I had never really considered scaling the business to millions of customers (aka users). \"Hackers and Painters\" entered my life just a few weeks before I was about to launch my product; and I realized I had to develop something that can scale. I took a leap of faith and decided to instead pursue web startups; the opportunities for growth were many times in magnitude.<p>2. There are others like me: Toronto, Canada is not exactly a Silicon Valley. So uptil then, I didn't know there were so many other young entrepreneurs pursuing the same goals as me. Eventhough I wasn't acquainted with other hackers, I could at least gain a sense of security that I am not alone.<p>3. The Art of the Start: The single most valuable lesson I learned from Paul's book was the governing dynamics of web startups. Before reading it, there was not much inspiration or reason to think big because even if I did venture into online startups, I wouldn't know what to do.<p>\nWhile I have read some excellent books, I can credit Paul's work for watering the first seeds.", "id": 5605, "time": 1174535789, "type": "comment", "by": "python_kiss"}

The discipline that allows you to do these things is the same discipline that makes it possible to work at a job you don't really enjoy.<p>Having said that, I agree with the approach of sacrificing quality-of-life for, say 5 years in order to never have to work again. Doing this for something you mostly enjoy will allow you to put in the effort without killing yourself. Unfortunately, this can become self-perpetuating.

{"parent": 3574, "text": "This is an interesting question, and as a girl geek who is applying to y combinator and has worked for many startups, I can mention a few things. <p>1) Startup culture appears to be a boys' club.  <p>a) Have you ever noticed that when you hire the first woman in any company, the dynamic changes? There's resistance to that change, whether it's for better or worse. (pun intended) There's a big sign on your clubhouse that says [GIRLZ KEEP OUT!] Sometimes it's very subtle. Sometimes overt. How many of you actually had women on the short list of people you were choosing to partner with? Some geeky guys still have a hard time talking with girls. It may be an issue with whom you're comfortable sharing your great idea. From what I've read in these posts, you have some assumptions that you're making about girls. Truth is, when you get to a certain level of skill or creativity, assumptions need to fly out the window - for both men and women. <p> b) With that being said, I love it when work consumes me with a passion and takes all of my time to the exclusion of all else. I have mad skills in a bunch of different areas and startups seem to want me. . . but they don't think of me as a co-founder. I code, design, do market research, marketing strategy, media buys, infrastructure, pitches. . .  basically I've worked for many startups doing everything necessary to get started. Still thought of as an accessory - never fully included. My solution to this has been to position myself differently - and I can do that now. I need to market my skills differently from the way guys do. This has been successful. <p>2) We're not as sensitive to hierarchies and heirarchies' flip side, competition, as guys are. <p>a) We often just want to get it done. We don't care as much if it strokes our ego or your ego. It needs to be done. If, every time we have a conversation, it becomes a zero sum game of who wins the dominance, it's stupid. <p>If there's a list of things that need to get done on the table, and some tasks are seen as too onerous for guys' job descriptions (egos), we wind up doing it because it needs to get done. Because we did it, somehow our status falls. We wind up getting stuck with _all_ the crappy jobs, and it winds up sucking for us as our status continually sinks. <p>b) We assess ourselves and our skills differently. Here's an illustrative example. A female engineer once told me why she gave up working in industry. She was the only woman working with a team of guys. The team lead would throw out a task for discussion on the table. Everyone but she would say they could do it easily. She would say that no, this has these challenges and would take much longer. One of the guys who said that it was easy would get the project and then go to her for help doing the problematic tasks. Who got promoted? The guy. Who was doing all the hard work? She was. Female examiners at the patent office tell the same story. There are a lot of women engineers who leave industry because they can assess themselves and the problems accurately and this isn't valued. Managers want their problems solved. They value gung-ho over truth.<p>c) This is often linguistic. Men and women use different syntax to express the same thoughts. I need to remap what makes sense to me onto another linguistic pattern and that seems to be a waste of energy. In fact, this has a lot of benefit because it makes us better communicators all around. It's a learning curve - and it's often hard to recognize that it's there or needed. (I was a linguistics geek in college, where I found out that 85% of all conversational interruptions occur men on women, so it's a challenge for us to get a complete paragraph size thought into a conversation - much less complete a sentence without being completely stepped on.) <p>But even in the more egalitarian parts of the States, there are different linguistic patterns for men and women. If you go to the South, it's much more amplified. If a woman makes a statement with the same intonation and wording as a guy, the conversation just stops for a hot minute while everyone in the room processes it. In places like Alabama, I need to preprocess so that the communication is seamless and the conversational stoppages don't occur - and this often means using what would be considered subservient speech, like ending a statement with a questionmark. Up north, if I'm in a roomful of guys, or even just talking with one, the preprocessing still needs to happen. <p>        d) It may be that because we're not as sensitive to hierarchies and have different sensibilities about status, money means something fundamentally different to us. <p>        e) When I was in college, I really wanted to go into physics, and I was good at it. I spent a summer working for NASA and saw how cutthroat the competition was among the physics geeks and didn't like it. Several years later, I was the webmaster for a hearing research center at a big university. It was a collection of twenty or so labs. I noticed that there were a lot of female scientists, that there was a lot of collaboration between scientists in this particular center and also around the world. I decided to find out what was so different and spent about a year asking people how it came about. <p>The story is interesting. It wasn't by accident. It turns out that at MIT thirty years ago, there was a hearing research professor who got all of his grad students together and told them that their careers didn't have to be all sniping and competitive - that they could do something different and agree to cooperate. These grad students are now the heads of their own departments. They teach their undergrad and grad students what behavior is acceptable and are growing a culture of deep respect and cooperation. It has a lot of benefits for hearing research as a whole. Work isn't hidden from each other and duplicated - meaning money and time isn't wasted - so it's much better for the hearing research discipline. There isn't the attitude of hoarding ideas for credit. Everyone's resum\u00e9 has long lists of collaborations. Mostly, everyone's really happy and nice. Apparently, vision research is the exact polar opposite. <p>I know that in a free market society, competition is seen as creating efficiency, but in a lot of ways, it's very wasteful because of hoarding of ideas and duplication of effort. For people who don't have access to resources, cooperation results in significantly greater value. There isn't nearly as much money available for hearing research, but these researchers are incredibly efficient because they eliminated the competition from the discipline. They're still evaluated. They still have to do their work and be very good at it. It's just that the element of fear is gone. <p>Alpha males and alpha females see competition differently. How many alpha males can be in a company at any one time? Those who aren't the tiny percent of you who are alpha males feel fear when there's excessive competition. Do you want to work in a fearful environment?<p>    3) If we're single and cute, the dominant chimp will hit on us unless he has a well developed sense of morals. I've been around and around with this one with other women about what to do in response to this and have seen a lot of different strategies to handle it. Some women just shut down their levels of expression and passion for their work. (sucky solution) I know one woman who pretended she was a lesbian. (sucky solution, but one of the most successful - she still retained respect) This comes up a lot at female executive dinners. It's tiresome because when the dominant chimp's ego's bruised there's _always_ retaliation of some form. <p>4) It may be that y combinator and the VC game doesn't get us where we want to be. <p>a) If the majority of all small businesses in the States are being started by women, and if we're especially good at communication and customer service, which you'd think would be great for Web 2.0, then what is it about the whole VC game that doesn't get us there? How are we starting our businesses without you? When we're starting businesses, what's the structure like? What kinds of businesses are they? <p>b) I know that usually VCs or angels don't even look at people until they've spent $50k of their own money. Women have a harder time coming up with funds like that. We still don't have wage parity. We're taking care of our parents or our sister's kids. It's harder for us to get out of family obligations. In the family, daughters are still thought of differently. While I was still an undergrad, I was a founder in a startup. I had to leave to take care of my sick mother. When I asked her if I were a guy, would she have asked me to give up my business, she replied, \"no.\" without any hesitation. We're still expected to do the bulk of non-market labor in this culture. If we say no, there are repercussions. Being a good girl is always for someone else's convenience. <p>c) It may be a timing thing. Women may have different goals immediately after college. It would be interesting to check to see how old the women are who are starting businesses in this country. I'd want to check the distribution graph - don't just look at the mean or median ages of when they're starting businesses - I bet there are several humps on it - each would tell a different story about that group's lives. By excluding women who are above a certain age, you're cutting out a lot of experience and wisdom. One of the coolest businesses was started by Mary Kay. However cheezy her pink Caddies are, she had a lot of insight into how women ran their lives and built her cosmetics distribution model on those insights.<p>d) I'm willing to bet that women are starting businesses with less, are entering businesses with lower barriers to entry in general, and that the geeky women aren't starting businesses or aren't going your route to do it. If you look at the percentage of female college grads in engineering and the sciences, it's a much higher percentage than who are applying to y combinator. How are their opportunities and thoughts different? Perhaps you should ask them. You're missing a lot of talent by not addressing it. Are there qualities that you are rewarding that talented women find reprehensible or icky?<p>By definition, you're looking for special people. The next Teslas are going to be odd no matter where they're from or what their gender is. What would have happened to Tesla if there had been no viciousness of Edison's smear campaigns? Clearly the world lost out. (I have a thing for Tesla, and in an ideal world, Firefly would still be on the air.) <p>If the next Tesla is currently wearing a burka in Afghanistan, she, and the world, are out of luck. If she's in school just down the river, or has just sent her kids off to college, you may be able to do something about it if you want to.

{"parent": 5825, "text": "[aristus, lost my passwd :)]<p>\"Eyecatching\" means garish, cluttered, etc. This is not always desirable. Usually it's reserved for wide-spectrum ads for cheap items, hence \"downmarket\". Audience drives design. If your audience is a few thousand rich wives you'll take the elegant route. If your audience is a million working girls your best response comes from more strident stuff. Since there are so many more working girls versus rich wives, it seems as if all DM is \"downmarket\". I am sure of this because I've seen the difference even a few changes can make, and I've seen years and years of real-world research on how different styles gather response for different things.<p>Let's say I'm doing an ad for big copiers. Artsy doesn't work here. You need strong, reassuring. Price isn't listed. Instead you want a couple of pictures, big (local!) phone number, local address, and an IBM-ish logo. IKON, formerly Alco, wanted to establish a trust brand that buyers don't have to think too hard about. So: IKON came out of \"I Know One Name\".<p>Now you are selling pizza. Number, types of food, price, delivery options, hours of operation. Closeups of bubbling cheese. Sizzle, not steak.<p>Cut to the iPhone. Popular yet hip. It's a fine line, and very few orgs can manage it. That's why Apple is the darling of the ad world. They are an outlier.<p>Another great fine-liner was Grey Poupon mustard. They took the visual cues of the rich, the exclusiveness, the clubby feel un-rich people imagine exists (\"But of course!\") and placed it right in front of the fact they were flogging mustard for 4 bucks a jar. But once that hook was in and the audience was ok with funny crunchy brown stuff, other fancy mustards went right back to the more familiar downmarket themes of \"fun for kids\" and \"kick it up a notch\".<p>...and so on. Non-commercial (and, frankly, inexperienced) artists tend to make the mistake that ads are not thought about too much or are made by folk who lack taste.

Here's another pass:<p>I completely get the fact that projects are not a bad thing.  Most of the best businesses actually started out as projects.<p>It makes total sense for me that startups should pursue building something people want (and make that the focus).  However, a subset of these are projects that seek to build something people want AND that they will pay for.  I'd further argue that within this particular subset of ideas, the optimal choice might be to build something people will pay for from the get go.  In these cases, it would be sub-optimal to simply strive to build something people want.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that in some situations, trying to find the problem that people want solved AND will pay for ends up putting the startup on the right idea wheresa if they simply tried to build something people want, they may wind up in the wrong place.<p>Not all software is best served by creating something that will be subsidized by another activity (like advertising).

If these two companies are fighting for share of a tiny pie, it's just stupid.  If the pie is much bigger than I believe it is, then the game for market share hasn't even begun yet.  The big players haven't even really placed their bets, and that's when things will get interesting (but you have to be there before the big players if you want a chance at walking away a big winner).<p>Anyway, it's not a market I'd want to go after, because I don't see it being big enough for so many contenders (there are others out there--it's not just these two).  But then, almost no market looks big \"enough\" to outsiders.  People are always confused when I make claims about how large our market is (niche software for a 10-20 billion dollar worldwide industry that's increasing at a couple billion per year).<p>So, if they've researched their market and found it large enough to make for big winners in a year or two, now is a fine time to enter it.  Just because you and I know all about 37signals and think they're cool, doesn't mean anybody else knows what the heck they're building.  The real market (folks who aren't web 2.0 developers) hasn't even begun buying this product on the web yet, and they certainly will.

Twitter, however, is designed for telecocooning. Telecocooning is traditionally defined as sending little \"presence pokes\" to people. For example, just saying hi or sending someone a picture of a heart or a smiley face. The point of these messages isn't the ideas they contain, but rather the message itself. That is, just getting any message from someone shows that the other person is thinking about them and cares about them.<p>Traditionally people telecocoon with their two or three closest friends. However, Twitter lowers the telecocooning barrier so you can telecocoon with many more friends for the same effort. People tend to just send messages like \"ahh homework sucks\" or \"heh stuck at the library.\" You aren't really communicating anything intelligent, but you are building a feeling of group solidarity by letting people around you know what's up.

{"kids": [6160, 6473], "parent": 6134, "text": "Great speech. My only comment is on the idea that we will look back on professionals as being like serfs. As Paul mentioned earlier, what is driving people into the service of others is a combination of social status, risk avoidance, and the need for \"structure.\"<p>I don't think risk avoidance and need for structure will ever change. The real question is whether our conceptions of social status will change. So I've been writing a lot recently about how organizations and institutions exploit people's need for social status in order to secure cheap labor and make money. <p>The most obvious example is how WoW literally allows you to \"level up.\" Even though objectively you are just spending 12 hours a day clicking on pictures of digital rats on a computer screen, qualitatively it's designed to make you feel like a hero. Everyone wants to be a hero in real life, but most people are just too lazy or untalented or risk adverse. It's not fair, but that's the way it is. Organizations have figured out how to tap into people's need to \"be the hero\" while extracting cheap labor (or purchases) from them. <p>A good example is when I was learning to play the trumpet. Learning to play a musical instrument is a very slow and continuous process. If my trumpet teacher were to have said, \"ok, today you are level one trumpet. ok, now you're level two trumpet. etc.\" I think most people could figure out it's a scam. Improving at trumpet is a continuous function, not something that happens in levels.<p>The thing is, when people say, \"ok, you're level one at education, you're level three at business.\" then no one realizes they are being exploited. In general, reality is very continuous. Whenever someone tries to represent a phenomena as something you can \"level up\" in, chances are they are trying to fuck you, take your money, or both. <p>Until people realize this is happening, professionalism will never go away. Instead people are obsessed with \"climbing the ladder.\" Thing is, climbing the ladder benefits the people at the top, not the bottom. The average person doesn't even realize this.<p>I think in order for this mentality to end, two things are needed:<p>1) People currently view social status as a function of what people with money and power think of you. People need to instead view social status a function of your ability to MSPW.<p>2) We need new forms of social signaling that take this into account. Currently people identify themselves through college credentials, brand name clothes, etc. I think social signaling DOES have an important economic role to play, however, we need new forms of social signaling based around MSPW.

You can't pick your technologies: you generally have to go along with what the rest of the team is already using.  You can't pick your company culture: it's already been established.  You can't pick your market (okay, you can't really either with your own startup).  You're stuck with the existing codebase.<p>All this is fine if you also pick up your employer's values and expectations.  But I don't know any startup founder that's like this.  Usually, if you're interested in starting a company, it's because you have some internal standards for the quality that you'd like your code to live up to and the ease with which users can use it.

{"kids": [6252, 6268], "parent": 6228, "text": "I think YCombinator is attempting great things and has a great strategy.  However, after StartupSchool I'm mulling over my intention to build my startup without getting any funding.  Yet, what I saw yesterday was mostly based on the assumption that a startup has to go thru rounds of funding.<p>A bit of background:  I'm not young, right out of college. I've been working for startups for about 18 years with a couple periodic stints at major tech companies. In all the startups I've worked for, the two leading causes of startup death are 1) Founder friction.  2) Stupid VC tricks.<p>Founder friction is a risk that I'm sure everyone understands.  But the risk of taking money from a VC is one that I think is under appreciated.   Generally these risks manifest themselves in the form of the VC meddling in the company to the theoretical benefit of the VC, and the companies detriment.   Speaking of instances I have intimate knowledge of, in one case the investment was contingent on 1/3 of it being spent on hardware and software from two companies that the VC had ties to-- overpriced hardware when commodity PCs would have done, and very expensive software that caused us to hire consultants (from the company that sold the software of course) to try and make it work, and ultimately forced us to revert to the original plan and build it ourselves.  Significantly delaying our ability to scale up the product.  <p>In another case the VC required that we hire a new CEO, and manuvered us into hiring a friend of the Partners who was non-technical and was fond of changing company direction quarterly whether we needed it or not, to follow the latest business fad... no matter how irrelevant it was to our industry.  (EG: one quarter it was \"Push\" and we were a company that made video game technology... nothing to do with \"Push\" but we had to have a \"push story\" and issue press releases.)<p>And of course, you can find lots of other examples of similar things happening at other companies. <p>I don't want to paint with too broad of a brush.  I recognize that my experience is limited to the half dozen startups I've worked for, and the dozen or so VC partners and associates I've known over the years. <p>But I have a strong impression that these are not people who understand technology, or the technology business well enough to give good advice.   Further, they have shown a propensity to force companies to go in a direction that helps their other investments, but may be detrimental to the company. <p>And, more importantly, is investment really necessary?  <p>In this day and age, you can get servers provisioned easily-- no need to commit to hardware purchases and long term datacenter leases.  The tools are high level and easy to use and there's a lot of open source to leverage so that you can focus on the added value part of your product.   Leverage has increased dramatically.  <p>Furthermore, companies are now starting to go without investment, such as MyBlogLog which was acquired only a few months after launch without doing a VC round. <p>Thus I reach the conclusion that the course for me to take is to not seek investment at all. <p>This may not be possible for someone who is recently out of college.  (And thus the funding from YC is not the kind of investment I'm talking about here-- the presusre to use the money to get three months of solid focus on the product is really positive \"interference\" especially when backed by the rapid feedback, networking, and weekly seminars.) <p>But if you start to get some traction with your product, and you're not building something that inherently requires massive investment... probably small angel rounds are the way to go until you can be acquired or reach profitability.<p>And while being acquired may always be wise-- reaching profitability is a milestone that I think truely marks success.  Nobody can ever take that away from you once you've done it-- its victory.<p>Startupschool was great-- was good inspiration, and much of what was said checked well with my thoughts giving me a boost in confidence that I'm on the right track. <p>I love lists like \"5 dos  and 5 don'ts\" or the X things that cause startups to fail, or Pauls 16 reasons... love to check those off and go \"Yep, Yep, Yep\"... and there were a couple that I need to work on. <p>Hopefully this little rant is not offending anybody... in summary, I'd say winning means making a viable business.  Getting VC funding shouldn't be the goal.", "id": 6237, "time": 1174873777, "type": "comment", "by": "BitGeek"}

{"parent": 6205, "text": "When investing in early stage companies, you put in less money and the upside is much greater. If this were the full picture then obviously early stage ventures would be a better deal. Of course, many more early stage companies go under than late stage companies. This extra risk is supposed to balance out the greater reward. But does it?<p>To borrow Kedrosky's terminology,  VC investing is really a combination of two separate skills: picking and poking. Picking is choosing which startups to invest in, and poking is helping the startup along to further its chances of success. <p>The vast majority of people investing in early stage ventures are friends, family, and fools. Because these people aren't very good at either picking or poking, their risk level is very high. This in turn drives up the cost of capital. <p>You can reduce your risk by becoming better at picking. You can also reduce your risk by becoming better at poking. And if you can become better at both, you can reduce your risk a huge amount. Because there are so few investors who are good at both, these people are barely even taken into account when determining the cost of capital. Which is why if you are good at both, it's an arbitrage opportunity for the investor.<p>For late stage ventures, there is much more money on the table which means much less amateur investment. Because you don't have as many dumb people pumping up the cost of capital, there isn't really any arbitrage opportunity. <p>Incidentally, PG has reduced his risk even further by creating news.YC so he can get to know the founders a little bit before investing. Theoretically, if a founder knows that PG has less risk because of this, the founder should be able to use this as leverage to get a better valuation. However, this doesn't work in reality because the shortage of PGs creates a market inefficiency (in favor of PG). However, I suspect that anyone who can successfully clone him will have a good arbitrage opportunity. ", "id": 6242, "time": 1174875409, "type": "comment", "by": "Alex3917"}

{"parent": 6198, "text": "This is a hard question.  I considered dropping out multiple times in college, but ended up sticking it out and getting my degree.  I'm still not sure if it was the right choice, but it seems to be working out so far.  Anyways, I have no answers, but I have some observations.<p>One of my main fears in college was that I would graduate, take a soul-crushing job, and then lose all desire to start a startup.  This hasn't happened.  I still want a successful startup just as much as I did in college, or maybe even more.  You're not going to stop wanting what you've always wanted just because you have a degree, a job, money, and options.<p>OTOH, having a job and an income fucks with your perceptions a little.  I was lucky (smart?) and didn't change my spending habits; over the past year and a half that I've been working, I banked close to 90% of my take-home pay.  Even though I'm financially much more secure than I was coming out of college, it feels much more precarious - I've gotten used to having a certain amount of money coming in each month.  Quitting my day job wouldn't be an issue if I didn't have a day job.<p>Don't underestimate the experience you'll learn on the job.  I feel like I've benefited significantly from working in somebody else's startup for a year and a half before trying my own.  It also creates a sense of momentum and gets your brain in gear; you'll need all the focus you can have when starting your startup.  <p>Don't overestimate the book learning you'll get in college.  Honestly, I don't think a single thing I learned in the classroom has helped me with my startup.  <p>OTOH, a lot of college learning occurs <i>outside</i> the classroom.  My impossible quest to complete a computer science major in one semester while the department would not let me declare one turned out to be <i>exactly</i> what startup life is all about.  There will be many moments when you have to work like hell for what feels like zero payoff.  It's a good experience to really fuck up and then recover from it, because you do that a lot with startups.  If you skip the recovery part in college, how do you know you'll be able to do it with your startup?<p>Also, I met my cofounders in college.  Had I left after freshman year, I would never have known them.  Had I left later, I probably wouldn't have kept in touch.<p>Probably the biggest factor in my decision not to leave is that I didn't have a clear idea what I would do instead.  That's probably the biggest determinant: if you know <i>exactly</i> what you'll be working on instead (like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, or Mark Zuckerberg) do that instead.  If you don't, stay in school, because you'll probably end up doing nothing instead, and nothing isn't a particularly good teacher.", "id": 6246, "time": 1174875997, "type": "comment", "by": "nostrademons"}

Leverage is the ability to magnify your efforts.  The bay area reduces your leverage.  Especially compared to somewhere like Seattle, or Portland, or Boulder, or Salt Lake City, etc.<p>11. Everyone is rude.  It's like living in New York or LA. The laid back california of the 70s is no more. Maybe Eureka or Weed or Barstow are good places, but the bay area is harsh.  Some relish the challenge, others just want to be left alone so they can be productive.  Being productive on your product increases leverage... <p>10. California looks so run down.  This is because it is.  The quality of life is declining rapidly.  There's nowhere to go to escape urban sprawl-- not close anyway and getting there is hours in gridlock.  Being unhappy decreases focus which decreases leverage.<p>9. The population density is so high, everyone is on prozac.  (I'm not kidding.)  Being depressed reduces leverage.<p>8. After spending 2 months there, I knew the business plans of 70+ companies in stealth mode.  Everyone knows what everyone else is doing.  Thus getting an edge on your competition is difficult, they may get your employees,  and they do know your ideas.   You have less leverage.<p>7. Every resource is in high demand, thus time spent finding real estate, finding equipment, is higher.  The local and state government levels of regulation are very high, and thus time spent dealing with the burocrats is much higher.  All these are distractions you don't need.<p>6. The availability of good startup quality employees is lower in the Bay Area.  Because startups per capita is much higher there, there are more startups competing for the same employees. <p>5. Office rent is expensive, Gas is expensive, Taxes are high, everything you could want to buy costs more.    Your burn rate is going to be much higher.<p>4. You can't find a place to live.  Your employees can't either.  Both you and your employees need more money to cover basic cost of living... your burn rate is much higher. <p>3. Being in the bay area means being on the VC treadmill.  This is the opposite of working for yourself, you are working for the VCs, and unless you triple their money in three years, you get nothing.  This forces bad decisions and much less leverage.<p>2. Long frustrating commutes reduce employee productivity and morale. They also reduce the length of the workday.<p>1. The state taxes capital gains like income!  So, even if you win, you lose.<p>\nThe upside... what rocks about the bay area:<p>10. Better S&M clubs.  Much. Better.<p>9.

As you get closer to larger companies, people on the road tend to be more rude.  I'm thinking of the San Jose/Milpitas area.  I think most of those workers are unhappy to be treading off to their anonymous jobs :)<p>10.  Disagree.  If you live on the 101, I could see how you would feel that way, but try to drive around los gatos or saratoga and say that.  No urban sprawl.  Plus, 'quality of life' is such a nebulous term....for me, quality of life is improved just by the energy of this place and the diverse types of people it attracts.<p>9.  I don't know anyone on prozac, and I'm not sure what that has to do with population density...<p>Speaking of population density/sprawl, I met this nice lady very recently who had just relocated from Paris.  Having been lucky enough to visit there myself, I had to tell her how beautiful I thought her city was.  She said that she was happy to leave, as the bay area was a \"lot greener\" (her words) and better for children.<p>8.  You point should show anyone why the bay area is a great place.  Where else would you know 70 founders??  And getting an edge on your competition doesn't necessarily involve secrecy....<p>7.  Totally agree about having to find a home, etc.  But the regulations are pretty minor from a biz standpoint relative to the benefits of doing business here.  <p>6.  Would you rather be a big fish in a small pond?  If your startup has potential, you should not only be able to compete with other startups to hire, you will be able to pick from among the best people in the world.<p>5.  Second order problems.  Instead of looking at expenses, you should be looking at the place that allows your startup to have the most room to grow.  If your primary concern is the cost of living, move to Thailand.  Gorgeous beaches, your dollar goes incredibly far, and oh, the closest thing to a technology company there is the guy selling electronic keychains on the street...<p>4.  I've been in the valley since 2000 - it's much easier to find a place here now than it was back then.  And salaries aren't that much higher here than they are in other tech centers in the USA or even Canada.<p>3.  Disagree.  Since when is having more options a negative thing?  If you don't need VC  money, don't spend your time chasing it.  But if you do, you'll  have a much better chance getting it here. <p>Face it - if you need VC money, the treadmill exists regardless of which city your business is situated in - you'll just have an easier time getting on the treadmill if you're in the bay area.<p>2.

The user gains some privileges, like being able to use \"bleeding-edge\" software or to get a valuable service for free, and in return they sacrifice the stability and reliability that comes with time-tested software; all that as they actually are an integral piece to testing that software. Without such a beta stage, the whole rapid development movement would fail as projects get mired in extensive internal testing stages.<p>Your GMail comment especially strikes me, as I hadn't considered that before.  Perhaps they grew much faster than anticipated and are still working on stability issues, and the \"losing my emails\" scenario may not be far off the mark.

{"parent": 6495, "text": "\"Hold some features back in your first release.<p>Release them next week or next month. This makes your customers think that you are actively developing your product and that there is momentum behind your product.\"<p>This statement really irks me, not just as a programmer, but as a consumer.  I initially thought the article might be a little joke, but since the other tips were more reasonable, I have to assume that it is serious.  I can understand holding back features in your initial release, but there are much better reasons than those that were cited.  To purposely trick your potential users seems to me to be a bad business model, and smells of the corporate mindset of money and growth over all else. I think it is important to remember that the whole point of developing a product is to fulfill a need (or want) of the customer, and I think that as the average consumer gets more intelligent, these types of tactics will be more transparent and will do more harm than good to the startup.<p>As for better reasons for holding back features:<p>1. In any interesting piece of software, I would imagine that there are potentially hundreds of features which could be added.  The difficult problem is deciding when to be (temporarily) content with what you have and release.  Thus, some desired features must be left out in order to avoid the perfectionist mindset, where nothing ever gets released.<p>2. A mostly-implemented feature may work correctly most of the time, but fail mysteriously at other times. Even with a beta release, it's probably best to avoid these types of features which only serve to make your product less reliable.<p>3. A feature may be fully-implemented, but there may be no clear way to integrate it into the UI.  In this case, it would probably be best to hold off and drop hints of the feature to beta testers, who could give their feedback on how best to integrate it.  After all, the feature is meant for the users to actually use, isn't it?<p>4. A feature may add computational complexity to the software which may be overly taxing on the initial hardware that a startup company is using. Improve the hardware before adding the feature, or better yet, improve the code which implements the feature.<p>\nAm I being overly idealistic?

You'd think this impossible: Paul announced the first YC program only about a week before its deadline and they got something like 250 applications.  Now they are all over the tech news and they still haven't cracked 1000?  Maybe PG's new speaking approach (memorize, practice, use visuals) is an effort to get more people fired up?  <p>Paul, regarding this new speaking style: you <i>could</i> make yourself into a Steve Jobs dynamo of a speaker, but I think you shouldn't.  Your usual wordsmith style is probably better for attracting nerds.      <p>Question: Paul, it sounds like you've mostly swung in the direction of encouraging people to look at their own lives for problems to solve.  Whereas in \"Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas\" you were saying the opposite, like in the two paragraphs starting with \"Reading the Wall Street Journal for a week should give anyone ideas... \"  Trevor says something similar in the footnotes.  But it looks like YC has been placing all its bets on the first sort of ideas.  There's a good reason: all the huge software successes come from the \"build it for you and your friends\" model because those are the problems you fully understand.  But it's more common to find software companies making solid profits on products they built for others' problems.  Am I overlooking YC companies building products designed for other people?  Is the problem that there just aren't enough potential founders like the Octopart guys: people deeply involved in some non-computing world who also happen to be good programmers?  If so, maybe the richest source of ideas and cofounders would be cruising web forums for the near-programmers (people who build things like MS Access half-solutions to their companies' problems) to listen to what they would like to build if only they knew how.

Besides, why compete with a free product?</i>  Once I actually visited the site and read the philosophy, however, I have to concede that it's at least worth a shot.  This idea is clearly the result of someone saying, \"What is wrong with Wikipedia, and how can we fix it?\"  The main problems, as I see it, are:<p>1. Defacing of high-profile articles.\n- This is potentially solved by requiring the use of real names, and also by the oversight.<p>2. Perceived inaccuracy.\n- While Wikipedia does at times have inaccuracies, the reality is that the media and others who do not often use it have an exaggerated view of the extent of the inaccuracy. By adding expert oversight, this should quell some of the cries regarding lack of reliability.<p>The only potential problems I see is that Wikipedia already has a lot of inertia, which includes a much better name.  Citizendium is just too hard to say to become a buzzword.  It will also see much slower growth, and I posit that it will never be able to reach the size of Wikipedia, because its growth function is inherently less steep.<p>That said, one could contend that the majority of quality articles on Wikipedia are submitted by a very small minority of the users.  If even some of these authors move to Citizendium due to frustration with the constant maintenance of their articles or the incorrect perception of inaccuracy, then Citizendium truly has a chance.

Version 1 of any Web 2.0 app can be built with 3 people in 3 months with very less capital needs (especially if the founders are fresh grads, all you need to do is to feed them for the three months). So as an investor, I would assume that you don't have to care much about revenue models, business experience & age of the founders, etc because in the event the startup tumbles, you don't stand to lose a lot?<p>But what about bigger projects? Projects which need maybe 10 people working for an year? Hardware? Would your views change when you are asked to invest in projects of these kind? The reason I ask is because I'm a final year CS student in Singapore and I've developed a 360 degree video camera along with a couple of my friends and we've been talking to a lot of angel investors here. They all love the idea and are amazed by the demo but most of the time their major cause of concern is that we don't have business experience and we're very young (21).

{"kids": [6941], "parent": 6668, "text": "\"It's exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like the one from farming to manufacturing.\"<p>The biggest reason why startups are so much more feasible now than ever before is because of the plummeting costs of production. Whereas twenty years ago it would have taken millions of dollars to do a startup, today a college kid with a powerbook can do one in his dorm room. Every year the tools of production get exponentially more powerful and less expensive.<p>To play devil's advocate, these same factors that are currently driving startups may ultimately be their demise as well. Almost every tool can be used for both good and evil. A hammer can be used to drive a nail, or also to harm someone. Governments have taken it on themselves to try to allow the good uses of any given technology while regulating the evil purposes. The problem is that every time they try to regulate away an evil, there is inevitably a little spill over that prevents us from using the technology for good. Every time a powerful new technology is invented, we end up losing little bits of our rights and civil liberties. <p>As technologies exponentiate in both their power and interconnectedness, it seems as if society (at least ours) will go down the road of increasingly restricting freedoms in order to prevent terrorism and other evils.<p>It isn't hard to imagine that as the costs of production approach zero, so will the freedoms that enable us to start startups. In many countries, such as Japan and Germany, it is so hard to do anything other than the status quo that it is effectively illegal. In Germany the government subsidizes the wages of students finishing school, which makes it effectively impossible to get a job without graduating. And in Japan it's even worse.<p>If the past is any indicator, the same forces driving the boom in startups are ultimately going to be drivers in forcing people into more restrictive social structures. <p>N.B. I don't necessarily believe this, but I think it is a serious argument that has never really been rebutted.

Most startups want to improve their pre-money valuation before going to the VC, the most important ingredient for achieving that is a stable system that is a result of successive relevant iterations of the features. This could as well be part of any Web 2.0 company's road map for the first few months upon going live. It is needless to say that for a VC to be convinced, it is important to have the right kind of users. If there is even a little bit of overlap between the 53,651 web savvy users and the ideal end-user, it is safe to assume that viral marketing will take care of itself. An example that glares in the face is Google. Their systems are the way they are, thanks to their #1 beta testers, their employees. And one could argue that there are other beta testers at various levels, namely the actual end users. This statistic seems to do more good than harm, if regarded positively. The eventual end users of the system could just be an extension of the 53,651 initial users. Go Techcrunch!!!", "id": 6875, "time": 1175074876, "type": "comment", "by": "nurall"}

I do think, however, that you are right in saying that it is very hard to rebut the idea that you present.<p>I don't really think, though, that what you present are the precise beliefs of Kaczynski.  In your comment, you seem to have the idea that decreasing costs of production (which is largely due to improvements in technology) is a good thing, while the decrease in freedom is the thing that is bad.  It seems to me that anarcho-primitivists actually believe that technology itself is the bad thing, because it departs from the pure, hierarchy-less society of hunter-gatherers.<p>It is truly an interesting endeavor to consider where the boundary exists between what is good about where we are headed and what is bad.  I think that all of us accept the idea that those who have greater drive and motivation to succeed should be rewarded for their efforts, and it's also hard to deny PG's contention that people now are living more luxurious lifestyles than kings of yesterday (heated houses year 'round).  We may also argue that if people are content with their station in life (i.e. doing nothing to change it), then what is the problem?<p>On the other hand, I think that nearly all of us would agree that a situation like that in the Matrix would be a bad thing; even though the people believe they are living well, it is all a facade.  Additionally, we are perfectly okay with improving the lives of friends and family members who have been less driven than we, presumably because we love them.<p>I guess if you consider the implications of that train of thought, if we loved humanity, we would be perfectly fine with sharing everything equally, regardless of the amount of work the individual does, and we thereby arrive back where we started, with hunter-gatherer cultures that have gift societies.  We can even see evidence of this model working in the open source movement today.<p>I'm not really trying to make any points here, I'm just pointing out some interesting questions that your post (and my readings on Kaczynski) brought up in my mind which made me question what I had previously considered to be unquestionable truths.  Perhaps it's not necessary for the entrepreneur's reward to be directly proportional to the amount of wealth the he or she has created, especially considering that with the current state of social stratification, opportunity is certainly not equal.", "id": 6941, "time": 1175100751, "type": "comment", "by": "BrandonM"}

{"parent": 7094, "text": "I think the main part of the \"Jobs-Wozniak\" relationship that people forget to mention is that Jobs approached Wozniak and thought that's what they should market.<p>In other words, you're not a Wozniak just because you're heavily into technology.  Wozniak created a bunch of stuff because he wanted something very useful for himself and he was going to create it on a tight budget.  That is actually what great leaders do (at least according to some leadership books and my own experience)--they don't create something and then force it onto other people.  Nor do they tell people what to do.  They simply start doing it themselves and then other people notice and want to take part.  (In other words, if you want people to do what you're saying, start doing it yourself and people will copy it or want to be around you when you prove it works.  Don't just start telling people what to do.)<p>So, Wozniak is more than a technical guy.  He was exhibiting silent leadership about hardware.  And Jobs was exhibiting leadership in how software should be later on.<p>If you think you want a Jobs, are you a Wozniak to even have such a comparison?  In other words, are you creating a software or hardware product for yourself that makes things so much easier and better that other people notice it and approach you and tell you, we can sell this?  Remember, Wozniak didn't ask anybody. That's the relationship that happened.  Not, \"Oh, you created a bunch of code, let's try to somehow convert it into a business.\"  The idea made sense in the first place.<p>So, if you're 100% technical, the best thing to do is to show what you do to everybody.  Don't force it on to them, and don't worry about anybody copying you since if you're clearly enjoying what you're doing and they think it's a worthwhile thing to do, everybody will want to join you.  Remember, if you're a Wozniak, it means you can basically display your ideas everywhere, even to roomfuls of technical people like Woz did, and know that everything will be OK.", "id": 7100, "time": 1175122864, "type": "comment", "by": "vlad"}

{"parent": 6668, "text": "\"Even the founders who fail don't seem to have such a bad time.\"<p>I was a founder in a startup that died late last year. It was the hardest I have ever worked, and one of the most challenging things I have ever done. It was frustrating in so many ways and there was amazing amounts of strife involved. In the end the project ran out of money and the products of my labor and imagination are now gathering dust in storage. After all that, without any monetary reward, I would do it all again in a second. The challenge of following my senses through completely unknown territory and the reward of seeing my idea come to life was more then enough to make the whole thing worth it. It was the challenge that drove me. In the end it was the challenge itself that rewarded me even though the company didn't fly.<p>\n\"A lot of people think they're too young to start a startup. Many are right. The median age worldwide is about 27...\"<p>I do agree completely with the idea that adulthood is a state of mind and not an age. I remember my dad asking me \"What do you want?\" when i was somewhere between 18 and 21. My reply at that time was \"I just want to be comfortable.\" I remember it quite distinctly. He then told me \"I expect that will change some day, given your creed.\" He was right,  and I realized it while in the midst of working my tail off on a project. All I wanted to do was work on my ideas, see them come to life. The discomfort didn't slow me down at all, it was the challenge that I wanted.<p>\n\"You need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder. It's probably the single best predictor of success.\"<p>A founder without determination is not going to succeed, but their drive can't cause them to loose perspective. One can dig with a singular purpose and make a big hole, but if it is in the wrong place it does the project no good.<p>\n\"You don't need to know anything about business to start a startup.\"<p>True, but eventually the business skills will be required if the project is to continue. My experiences have taught me that while a viable product is most of the battle, a lack of resources on the business end of a project can stop it in it's tracks. Weather it is the founders themselfs that learn the skills, or outside resources are brought in to help - the skills must be obtained. The lesson I learned is pick the right people to depend on, or depend on yourself. Implementing your ideas is great all in itself, but it is much better if there is someone interesting there to see it when you finish.<p>\"If you don't have a co founder, what should you do? Get one.\"<p>Be careful! Going into business with someone in the startup environment is a commitment. You will spend allot of time with them and you will have to depend on them constantly. It is almost like a marriage, choose wisely. Good friends do not always make good business partners.<p>\n\"In a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea...\"<p>I believe that a person's ability to learn, gain skills, and adapt is the most important thing period. You find someone with a carrot, you've just got a carrot. Even if you need a carrot, their value is limited once they give it to you. Find a gardener and you can grow anything you need. Reminds me of some proverb about choosing a fishing pole or a fish.<p>\n\"This one is real. I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start a startup.\"<p>I agree with this 100%. I did it, and I would not advise it for someone with a choice. My family is amazing and supportive and more then anything else they KNOW me. I have founder pumping through my veins. The startup world is home to me, there is no question that I will be a serial entrepreneur. Good ideas give me goosebumps, unsolved problems give me insomnia. My family supports who I am, so I am able to do what makes me happy. Successfully pouring your soul into a project and being a member of a family at the same time is a learned skill. Play it safe unless you know what you are getting into, or just can't change who you are.<p>\n\"Start another company? Are you crazy?\"<p>See above.<p>\n\"Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you'll probably end up working there for as long as a startup would take, and you'll find you have much less spare time than you might expect.\"<p>Working a regular job instead of chasing dreams is still a commitment. Yes, you can work a regular job without thinking about it all the time. You can go to work 8 hours a day 5 days a week and not have it take over the rest of your personal time. Having said that, is it really worth it? Why do something all day that you don't care about? Sounds flawed to me.<p>\n\"Each person should just do what they need to without anyone telling them.\"<p>This throws back to the \"pick carefully\" comment. Your choice in business partners is paramount. There are many many people who will just stand there on the field with the ball looking confused. Within the constraints of a startup you may not have time to figure it out after the fact. Make sure you know they can work, and that they can work with you.<p>\n\"If you go to work for Microsoft, you can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will be like\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0097all too accurately, in fact. If you start a startup, anything might happen.\"<p>This is part of what attracts me to the role of a founder. Clicking send on an important proposal and not knowing what will happen is like jumping off a bridge for me (with cord of course). I love not knowing, I love the process of finding out. I love the risks you have to take and the rewards you can reap. Anything can happen, and that resonates with me.<p>\n\"A significant number of would-be startup founders are probably dissuaded from doing it by their parents.\"<p>This is a problem I never had. My dad tells a story about having a booth across the aisle from Oracle WAY back when they were both small. He was lead developer on a similar DB app called RDM which was a far more mature and fully featured product at the time. His business leaders thought conservatively, Oracle shot for the stars. The rest is history. My father will never discourage me from chasing my ideas, and my mom just loves to see me glow. He was there, at the time and the place; he chose the steady paycheck.<p>\n\"Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons because the weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you'd have to get up and go to work. How did they stand it?\"<p>What, as apposed to kicking back - stretching out - and wondering what day it is on Sunday afternoon? Never.. operating by the seat of your pants and living your ideas is the only way to go. Its the best feeling in the world, and the bad times only make the good ones better.<p>[edit] Getting my proverbs straight.", "id": 7210, "time": 1175149673, "type": "comment", "by": "blats"}

{"kids": [7503, 7313], "parent": 7182, "text": "The problem with motivation for an undergrad is when you realize that everything doesn't need to be the way it is now.  Let me clarify.  Most of us have been raised our whole lives with the mantra, \"You have to go to college to succeed.\"  I know that my parents didn't go to college, and they were always saying, \"You don't want to end up where I am, working in a factory,\" etc.<p>The problem with that model, however, is that a standard undergraduate education is beginning to become old-fashioned and irrelevant.  How many stories do you hear about students going to four years of school only to graduate and be unable to find employment?  While the problem is not nearly as bad in engineering as in other fields, it's still the case that more and more people are going to college, and as a result, a degree doesn't look nearly as great as it did 20 or 30 years ago.<p>I personally have started to become disenfranchised with the college model in the US.  As an undergrad, I have visited some undergraduate committee meetings and talked personally with a few professors, and the bureaucracy of the whole thing is somewhat disgusting.  Even if a professor wants to make a change to the curriculum (for the better), he or she must endure countless meetings and votes, even for something that is clearly a good idea.  It may take a year or more just to make a minor structural change in a few core courses.<p>Moreover, department heads are not much worried about the success (or lack thereof) of undergrads.  For whatever reason, national groups that rank colleges look mainly at entrance criteria, so as long as the college can successfully lock out those students with low ACT scores (which are largely irrelevant), they look good on paper.  Meanwhile, they hire new professors based <i>only</i> on their research and some interviews, without much regard for teaching backgrounds.<p>In the end, once you go off and create your own startup and work on your own projects, you start to see that college is largely not helpful to an undergrad.  The stuff that is stretched out over four years could probably be learned quite easily by most in two or less, if it was all restructured a bit.  College, in effect, is just another corporation, one that is in the business of paying professors and researching new ideas.  It just happens that most professors do not produce enough ideas quickly enough to justify their income, so undergraduate students make up for that by paying tuition.<p>Once you realize that you can be successful without completing (or even starting) your undergrad, the dedication, motivation, and finances necessary to complete college just don't look like such a good trade anymore.  Most courses follow a textbook, anyways, so just buy the textbook, study it yourself, talk to people online, and you will probably do just as well.  The only downside is that you'll be missing that shiny piece of paper.", "id": 7283, "time": 1175180029, "type": "comment", "by": "BrandonM"}

Basically what it sounds like is that if there is ANY indication that you started work on a startup while under an IP agreement, VCs and acquirers will simply not touch you. Has any one else found this to be the case?<p>From what it looks like so far, my options are:<p>1) Jump ship and not look back. This puts big financial strain on us though as we don't have funding yet.<p>2) Leave as an employee, and rejoin as a part time contractor without signing an IP agreement. This would pay the bills and rent in the early stages but would probably be pretty draining physically. I also lose my unvested shares in the company but meh.<p>3) The CEO will sign a document releasing our specific idea from the IP Agreement. Has anyone heard of this happening with success before??<p>Or we could probably just start working in secret and building the product, but this is probably not a good idea because we wouldn't have early customer feedback.

Why lose a mortgage (and your wife!) over a dream? If you're married and want to have a family, get a stable job, get a mortgage and take care of your family's future. Not having any money (or very little) for few years can be extremely stressful on a marriage... especially if you're not financially stable. If you're financially stable and have millions in the bank, well, then this does not apply to you and you can do whatever pleases you.<p>2) You won't have as much time since your wife will demand that you spend a lot of time with her. If you're in a startup, your startup will be your wife and your kid and your family for at least a year. You'll be competing against other teams which don't have time limitations and against people who are working 12-14 hr days. You simply won't be able to compete with them. If you start spending less time in a startup than your cofounders, there will be some serious tensions!<p>3) Do you have young kids? Spend your time with kids, not in a startup. You'll be glad you did later on. No matter how much money you make, you won't be able to buy back time!<p>Anyway, I speak from experience.

{"parent": 7315, "text": "Hi, Omarish.  The tragedy of the commons (economists call these situations \"negative externalities\") doesn't apply to Web 2.0 in my opinion.  <p>The tragedy of the commons stems from a basic cost/benefit calculation: in business, if something costs you more than you make, you either stop selling it or you go out of business.  The basic problem of a negative externality is that while the profit accrues to an individual, the cost hidden from that individual and is borne by the community.  So a non-viable activity continues to be performed, until the community goes bankrupt. (I.e., the field is depleted and cannot sustain sheep).  Some argue that pollution falls into this category.  (Note that this is not necessarily an argument for private ownership of everything: the principle problem is costs exceeding benefits, and those costs being hidden from producers so that their incentives are misaligned.  Privatization is one way, but probably not the only way, to align incentives.)<p>But in Web 2.0, there are no hidden costs that are depleting the overall store.  Companies pay for their bandwidth, pay for their storage, etc.  No costs are shifted to the community as near as I can tell.  <p>A better model for what you're talking about might be network effects -  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects</a>\n", "id": 7325, "time": 1175186758, "type": "comment", "by": "rfrey"}

I'm an environmentalist and refugee infrastructure consultant by trade, although I did spend about 10 years doing software including a number of start ups. My projects include minor roles in <a href=\"http://oilendgame.org/\">http://oilendgame.org/</a> <a href=\"http://smallisprofitable.org\">http://smallisprofitable.org</a> and technical lead on <a href=\"http://database.biomimicry.org/\">http://database.biomimicry.org/</a><p>My main project is an award winning, public domain / free/libre refugee shelter system called the hexayurt.<p>So, I've got a technology that I'm looking to get turned into a product. For ethical reasons there will be no patents or IP protection - you could write a closed implementation, patent additional side features etc - but the basic ideas are already disclosed. The cat is out of the bag, because this is refugee stuff which <i>just happens</i> to have some other applications, and so I disclosed it to make sure it would not be patentable from my work. There may be other patent issues, although none have arisen so far - we have yet to hit prior art.<p>Technologies: mobile phone programming, 2D bar codes, very large databases, and some basic understanding of cryptosystems. Like, how to call the libraries, not how to roll your own broken encryption.<p>Now, here's the kicker: if I'm not <i>entirely</i> mistaken, I have a customer lined up. A Large Customer. If that turns out not to be true, there's no point starting this thing.<p>If, however, it is, the gig would start with one large contract, and then if you can then make this into a company, you go right ahead. I'm fully engaged pushing the Hexayurt Shelter System (a free/libre refugee infrastructure system) and don't have time to do a start up. I can advise, and make the introductions. From there in it would be up to you to make it a success, working with that client.

The core challenge is to print a lot of data on an A4 / US Letter sized piece of paper, and then get that data back off the paper and into an application running on a cell phone.<p>Ideally, this would work on any old phone. Realistically, this would be vertically integrated - you'd get to pick the phone, and the printing format for the page containing the data. From the specs and the initial discussions I've had with companies in the field, the speed of light for 2D bar codes is about 3mb per page (Data Matrix) and the choke point is mobile phone camera quality, particularly focal length issues (can't focus properly on the close page.)<p>Approaches: using better phones, deconvolution algorithms, c'mon guys, you know how to fix this.<p>After that, there's some extremely simple large scale database stuff which looks, to my eye at least, to be a natural fit for REST. <p>Basically:<p>Yank data off the page<p>think about it<p>do stuff over GPRS/3G or - ugh - SMS (yeah... SMS out, SMS back... terse data formats.)<p>Done.<p>Nothing about this is difficult. The crypto fits in just to ensure data integrity - make sure that the bar codes haven't been damaged, or that the data on the bar codes isn't stale.<p>Ok? Enough here to be going on with? Do we need to belabor the point further? For the right team, <i></i>assuming<i></i> the deal comes through, this would be an easy gig.<p>If it doesn't, there's no gig, no client, no business, even if I disclosed the rest of the pieces here. So it's a potential and there's not much you can do to make it happen or not. But if it does come through, first plausible team might make a pretty good living for a few months and possibly be left with a viable company at the end of it. Can't promise more than that. In terms of IP, there would be full disclosure, no NDAs, no patents on my work as I described. There could be competition, although probably not, and for other reasons I'm not simply posting the whole damn design on the internet (more on that angle later.)<p>Ok, done.

I went to a Montessori school from kindergarten through third grade, and I can't stress enough how badly that specific Montessori school failed.  Teachers were distant, more like babysitters than having any kind of structure.  Any project we wanted to work on was fine, but most of us didn't do anything (the equivalent of pretending to work at work).  We'd have to keep track of what we did in journals and get them signed by a teacher, so most of us made up stuff and forged the teacher's signature.  I don't remember learning any mathematics at all back then.  In fact, I'm positive that it wasn't until fourth grade that I got into basic math.  I don't know if that's normal, but my father had been teaching me math outside of school from a very early age, so I was still strong in it.  It's a very strange school system.<p>My final observation is that my Montessori school was so <i>small</i>!  I was a shy kid, and going to a small school from K-3rd grade, then another small school from 4th-8th grade, did not help me to become a social person one bit.  If you do something against the group, everyone will hate you, resulting in more shyness.  Even at third grade.<p>You probably should evaluate your child.  Is s/he shy?  If so, it may be a benefit to send them to a larger school.

The NASDAQ had just peaked, but nobody knew it yet.<p>We got picked up first by the local community newspapers, then the Boston Herald, then the local TV news.  Then we ran out of funding, but we continued getting press inquiries for several months after we were technically out of business.  <p>We had a $20k PR budget (which we inflated to $50k whenever we talked to people), but we never spent any of it.  Instead, our (18 year old) PR guy would just cold call newspaper editors with \"Hi, this is Trip Guray, I'm at an all-teenage startup called inAsphere.com, and we have a story you might be interested in.\"  If they weren't interested, fine, we'd say thanks for your time and try someone else.  If they were, we'd send them a press release over e-mail or arrange for an interview.<p>Press coverage tends to snowball: if you get a story published in a community newspaper, you're much more likely to get picked up by a major metropolitan newspaper.

{"parent": 8110, "text": "Here are some thoughts I have regarding popularity meters on news sites and such. Maybe some people would find it interesting or possibly useful. I would also love to hear other opinions, so do share.<p>I am sure many readers here have seen the new SlashRating box, which sports digg-esque (generally speaking) number ratings for each article. Maybe you noticed that the Gmail Paper article (<a href=\"http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/0631243.shtml)\">http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/0631243.shtml)</a> and the X-Files article right after it (<a href=\"http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/1231211.shtml)\">http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/1231211.shtml)</a> have substantially different SlashRatings (1000x+ difference). Humor aside, they may both be valid ratings. Readers familiar with digg (easy example) have seen ratings ranging from the single digits, to way through the thousands. I believe there is a limit to the informativeness of the number rating. And while many services have jumped onto using similar number-based displays of popularity, here I make a case for the relative measure.<p>As a passer-by, casual reader on digg (which is most readers), when you see a page full of ratings in the hundereds, you probably process only two things from the score: the digit length and leftmost digit. When a 1000+ rating appears, you immediately know from the digit length that it is a magnitude more popular. More than what? More than the surrounding articles. Naturally, your eyes will notice the highest ratings within the page. If you reach a page full of articles rated in the thousands, readers probably apply the same strategy: scan the digit length and the leftmost digit. Unless two or more articles are rated on a higher order of magnitude than the rest, readers would likely ignore the less significant digits -- and when such a comparison is required, the articles are probably popular enough that you read them all.<p>After you mentally shift to a scale of comparison, you ignore details on other orders of magnitude; this is, for example, how your eyes adjust to consistently bright, or dark, environments. Of course numbers are easy to output and fast to read, and details may be interesting and important to the developers, but for browsing efficiency, most readers do not care, nor need to know, if something is rated 4903, or 4692, points, as long as a reference exists for comparison. And this reference will always depend on the number of participating users at a given moment. A better system should thus display only a relative measurement of popularity within a given timeframe. This idea is not necessarily new, but I believe it is definitely a better approach to popularity measurements, and moreso if you are expecting your project to eventually support a large votership.<p>An existing example to illustrate good use of this is something like a community download site. Say something is \"popular\" when over 50% of the users download it. It makes more sense then, to just write \"popular\" when total_downloads / total_users  0.5, rather than showing \"1,040 downloads!\", or even \"5,503,395 downloads!\" (okay, millions is different... but if your users were, like, ants, big deal). In the end, \"popularity\" is a relative measure.<p>I'm sure many folks here have thoughts on related issues; let's hear them :)", "id": 8111, "time": 1175483202, "type": "comment", "by": "whacked_new"}

It seems stupid to argue this when nothing has achieved, but this delicate and sensitive issue has impeded many cooperations.

The two-term formula was obtained by classifying the almost-injective functions using a regular grammar; the closed term arose from a sub-language closed under concatenation. Computer experiments suggest that a class of enumeration problems arising from regular monoids have closed form hypergeometric enumeration formulas. <p>Finding an algorithm for computing closed forms of indefinite binomial coefficient sums was an open problem in Knuth's Art of Programming; it was solved by Wilf and Zeilberger. In the example I considered, there is no closed form solution; however there is a way of finding a  decomposition of the sum with good properties. Finding the asymptotically significant term required an idea: the point is that the algorithms I used don't help you find this. One of those algorithms I used was due to R. W.

We do believe that somewhere down the road we may come up with some new tool or way of doing things that is patentable (heck, if Amazon can do it with \"1-click\"...) and will pursue that as it comes up.<p>In the larger picture, though, I don't think that this is going to make or break anybody. I went to a workshop a few weeks ago that was hosted by the Stern School of Business - they had a panel of VCs and one Angel Investor, a startup business pitching to them, and an audience full of people able to ask questions. What was interesting was that one of the first questions the VCs asked after the pitch was \"do you have any patents?\" The answer was a pretty straight-forward \"no.\" BUT, when asked about it later by someone in the audience, all of the VCs agreed that they didn't really care that the team didn't have anything patented - that they'd rather see a startup spending their time and energy on implementation than on developing a patent portfolio. Really, they just asked the question because they HAVE to ask the question.<p>I think the larger question here is \"why can't someone else do what you're doing?\" and the \"do you have any patents?\" question is the first logical step in answering that. But it's not the end-all be-all. I'm pretty sure Amazon's success really has very little to do with \"1-click\" and that this wan't even patented until a couple of years ago.

If I knew how to market Granmos to the point of becoming a monopoly crushing success I would probably already be getting paid millions as a consultant. I know Granmos can be successful, even if it doesn't reach the ten million user mark.<p>PR is a very important way of marketing for Granmos. You can do a local newspaper press release. Write an article about how a college student is making it easy for his grandparents to use computers. Send it to every local newspaper in America. Get new users. This is the kind of thing you can do for free, but professional PR people do it better.<p>Maybe I could do something really crazy, like giving stock options to anyone who acts as an evangelist or developer.<p>As for advertising, it would mainly be cost-per-action style ads.

We wanted to show potential employers that we were docile and persistent enough to continue attending said elite private college, even though we had accomplished #1.<p>3. We wanted to get to know lots of other people who were willing to pay $40K/year for the privilege of #1 and #2.<p>Of course, once you get out in the working world and actually get involved in hiring decisions, you quickly learn that there's not <i>that much</i> difference in the quality of education at various universities.  Harvard's classroom instruction is not much better than any other top-tier college, and may actually be worse.  MIT's is probably better, but it's nothing that a couple of guys from UVA (ahem, Reddit) can't pick up in their spare time.<p>Instead, you look at the Education section on a resume because people have already done the hard work for you.  Someone at Harvard painstakingly went through 18 years of that candidate's life and decided that they were good enough for Harvard.  I've got code to write: I don't have time to spend digging through a candidate's background.  If it's good enough for Harvard, it's good enough for me.<p>So, the business idea I came up with was a simple certification program.

I'm just glad to see someone might be doing something cool to circumvent the current college standard. <p>As much as i talk about college being a big fat waste of time and money, I generally enjoyed my time spent there. I had an awesome marketing job with one of the greatest companies/brands in the world and made some stellar contacts. It was the job offers halfway through college that showed me that the experience was worth MUCH more than the diploma. Finding out that jobs that \"require\" college degrees really just require proof that you are capable and determined was a great realization. <p>If you can demonstrate to a company that you have what it takes, waiting for you to finish your degree could be a waste of time for all parties involved. <p>So if your goal is to get a good job... it is entirely possible without a degree. Your friends and family may tell you otherwise, and very few people will encourage you to drop out to take a job... but it's your decision. Having a degree hardly dictates your happiness or success as a person. <p>I ended up leaving school after 3.5 years. Not to take a job, just because it was clearly a waste of my time. I wanted to focus on starting/building my company, and school was just getting in the way of that. Incidentally I found (sorta like Seth) a way that I could get my last semester's worth of credits from my university - so i'll still have that \"all mighty piece of paper\" in a couple months.<p>My suggestion to people usually is: Do what you want! Fitting the social norm is easy and will probably work out for you, but it might not be the best choice. If I were to go to college again, I'd study something that interested me as a person. Not something that I felt was a happy medium between interesting and a safe career path. <p><i></i><i></i><i>\nYou should go to college to learn about something you think is cool & enjoy your time spent there. Study art or music, history of physics... something that will make you want to attend early morning class discussions. Get involved on campus, network with people, and use your free-time to read and figure out how you're going to make your mark. If you're just going to school to prepare for a job... rethink why you'd spend your time and money being lectured and quizzed on material from drab books who's curriculum is behind the times anyway. If you are planning to start a company, you'll know for yourself if college is important to you or not. <p>", "id": 8607, "time": 1175634925, "type": "comment", "by": "mauricecheeks"}

If you pay for your own personal health insurance or do it as a sole proprietorship, etc. you're basically getting a raw deal from Congress.<p>I'm in California, where basically any 2+ person small business that's been around about like 3-6 months is guaranteed group health insurance for its employees at no more than 10% over an index that represents what bigger companies pay.  It's a sweet deal.  So if you're in California and are going to go this route, you may want to incorporate ahead of time to start that clock ticking.<p>So basically the company pays for the insurance for the founders, even though they're not drawing a salary.

Without insurance you're looking at least $110 for per doctor visit and about $90 bucks and up depending on what meds you need (PER prescription). Or let's say you broke your arm or leg because you tripped on your shoe laces while walking down the stairs of the Y Combinator building.   Without insurance you're looking at about $2500 and up to get it fixed and that doesn't include the cost of seeing a doctor added into it.<p>Paying $120 bucks a month to cover potential injuries or finding affordable medical insurance and covering yourself for potential injuries is a definitely an important factor not only for yourself, your company, but also to prevent you from getting your co-founders sick.  <p>It is true that if you're younger you are less likely to get sick.

I didn't know him. I didn't look at a resume. I had one conversation with him. I just read his blog, and I could tell from his writing that he would do a good job. Actually, his blog was just his fiction writing and he was a UI designer and coder but I could still tell from his thinking. He was so smart--a structured, logical, deep and creative thinker. It was clear to me that he would do a good job. He did. I tend to be a perfectionist, and he was the only person I've ever hired that did a perfect job. I had absolutely no criticisms about him. He always exceeded my expectations. It was amazing. I love working with the best people--nothing is more fun.  <p>If they didn't have a blog, I'd tell them to write down their thoughts every day for a few weeks and then I'd read it. I believe that you can't tell anything about anyone except how they behave over time. People lie and misrepresent themselves. But it's pretty much impossible to misrepresent yourself over a period of time. <p>I might try and give them a few of my problems to work on as well. But, if someone isn't the quickest thinker and can't answer a problem I give them in an hour-long interview I really don't care. What if they're amazing problem solvers but they just take overnight? One of the smartest people I know is like this. <p>With a blog, or writing over time, you also get a sense of how well they can articulate their ideas--if they have amazing ideas but they can't articulate them well, then the quality of their ideas doesn't matter. If for some reason they're terrible writers but still smart, you can just have them create a podcast. If they can't do either, then they can't articulate themselves enough to be useful to a company.<p>Watching their thinking over time, you can see how many ideas they generate, since you don't just want people that will only solve the problems you have. You want people that see things you can't and generate ideas themselves. <p>I don't care about how well people fit in. A start-up isn't a clique of best friends, although you certainly need people that you can be bluntly honest with and can be bluntly honest with you. It's better if you like them, of course, but I'm never trying to build any kind of culture except a culture of excellence--well, excellence on deadline. <p>Another thing I've always wanted to try is just to hire someone for two weeks and give them non-critical tasks to do. I could see if they met deadlines and how they actually worked.

With the JavaScript (AJAX) technology saving CPU server cycles[1] by doing a lot of logic in the web browser itself, Paul's one paragraph predicting something he expected to occur within a few months now sounds way ahead of its time.  Either that, or such technology has taken 10 years too long to brew.  (Coffee reference!)<p>I would also like to read the business plans of crazy dot com companies which tanked immediately.  It would be great to be able to contrast the two.  I'm thinking those business plans probably used a lot of made-up words to confuse the investors.  Paul's document is pretty succinct.<p>[1] as well as saving bandwidth and time, of course.", "id": 9147, "time": 1175770987, "type": "comment", "by": "vlad"}

Actually the current systems are rather unsatisfying because a state can loose its credibility and thus the trust in its curreny quite fast, basically as soon as war looms on the horizon or it becomes apparent that it will default on its debt. In the last 25 years over 87 currencies crashed.\nAnd because of the monopoly of the state on money the whole economy is usually going down along. For my part I would therefore abandon the monetary monopoly of the state and allow competition, allow companies to issue money. When they connect their name to the currency and have no legal power to make their money legal tender they will have a much stronger incentive to provide a good and stable money. Hayek wrote a fascinating treatise on the denationalisation of money, and with the ongoing globalisation sooner or later we will get used to juggle with more than one currency in our pockets. Second Life seems to be a step in the direction that companies start to issue private currencies and when states, especially in the developing countries, will fail to keep their currency stable chances are that they will be replaced by private currencies. <p>Equally interesting and probably easier to believe are gold backed currencies with competing private institutes issuing goldbacked money.<p>Still, its great to see people thinking about money in another way than just how to get it.\n", "id": 9150, "time": 1175773242, "type": "comment", "by": "dageroth"}

Alternative syntaxes have never taken hold in the Lisp world, which <i>may</i> mean they just offer nothing to an experienced Lisp hacker, but they're certainly not impossible.<p>You can have user-definable infix operators; Haskell has them and uses them to good effect. (The way Haskell does it, you can't have identifiers composed of both letters and operator characters, which Lisp people like to do, but I think we can safely treat that as a matter of taste.) You pick a symbol, say ~, and assign it a precedence and left- or right-associativity:<p>infixr 3 ~<p>infixl 7 .!.<p>Now (x ~ y .!. z) is parsed as ((~) x ((.!.) y z)), where (~) is the Haskell way of making the ~ operator as a prefix function. Haskell also lets you use a prefix function as an infix operator, by putting backquotes around it.<p>If you want to apply this in Lisp, there is the issue that (foo) means something else than foo; I would like to allow (foo x + bar y) to mean ((+) (foo x) (bar y)), but I wouldn't want (x + y) to mean ((+) (x) (y)). My solution would be that a single value is parsed as just a value, but multiple values next to each other is a function call: (foo x + y) is ((+) (foo x) y), to call y without parameters you have to write (foo x + (y)).<p>This leaves you with the parantheses for control structures and the like.

What will advertising look like as video programming and advertising dollars shift to the web? Where are those advertising dollars going to go, who will decide on the content these dollars will fund, and who will provide this content?<p>I think the most important thing Garfield notes in this article is the huge shift in power has occurred with the advent of dvr and web video. People don't have to sit through flashy, in-your-face ads that shout 'buy me!.' These ads can be fast-forwarded or deleted. On the web, the attention span of the viewer is drastically reduced by the sheer volume and choice of content. Why would I watch an ad when I don't have to on this site over here? The audience is no longer captive. The student has become the teacher. We are in charge. <p>Advertising and networks are not doomed in any sense.  However, traditional, 'flashy' ads will have to be replaced by more informative, interactive, gentle, pull advertising content. Think product placement, contests, video games, informational videos... Ad content will also be interactive-the best way to extend the short-attention span of the average web user. Just because networks are reeling in costs does in no way mean that they are 'over.'  \n  \nYes, traditional purveyors of advertising and large networks should be concerned, but only if they do not adapt to this huge shift in power. These networks and ad companies became successful because of innovation and I am sure they will temper the storm. However, who should be taking close note of this market shift is ambitious independent producers and content providers. There is a huge gap in the market for a few companies to sneak in and make an absolute killing. <p>To summarize: Because the viewer is in charge, ads in the future will inform rather than entertain, engage rather than impress, so really, the only question to answer is, what do the end users want to know and from whom?\nI believe local expertise and endorsement to be the untapped goldmine of this 'new' advertising.", "id": 9300, "time": 1175795954, "type": "comment", "by": "rebecca_d"}

{"parent": 9352, "text": "Rick Segal's approach seems the most charitable. <p>It works similarly in dating. \n(Note that I date with the goal of marriage in mind - definitely not a player, which makes this a good analogy to the good VC's - they're hoping to 'marry' founders when it's a good match)<p>Many guys burn bridges when they have to break up with a girl. However, that's totally unnecessary! I've certainly done that when I was a teen, but have found the charitable approach much more effective. Let me be clear that 'charitable' does not mean unclear or deceptive in the breakup. On the contrary - it's being very clear and honest about the breakup with the girl. That being said, you <i>do</i> withhold any information that would unnecessarily hurt her (ex: you're not attracted to something about her that she can't help).<p>The breakup needs to establish that:<p>1) the relationship is not a match for you, but that that is no reflection on her personally in the slightest<p>2) you genuinely admire the N number of amazing things about her<p>3) you hope that you both can still be good friends, but that you understand and honor her wish if she thinks it's better not to<p>4) the romantic possibilities of your relationship are just not there sufficient for marriage and never will be (let her move on with closure!) Don't worry, if you change your mind later you can crawl back on your knees to her and tell her you were wrong - but you have to let her go and pursue other possibilities.<p>5) you are open to talk with her about it at any time - this will usually relieve a lot of her anxiety about having to wonder why you broke up later.<p>Note: Be careful about the 'still being friends' thing. If you are hanging out too much with her, most other guys will avoid asking her out - and you don't want to hinder her ability to move on. Be sure to honor her space and let her know that you are doing that so she doesn't feel rejected by it.<p>Success stories:<p>2004 girlfriend: Good breakup, she decided it was better for her to not have contact. I honored that and imagine she has gone on to great things.<p>2005 girlfriend: Good breakup, though we did get back together several times. Ultimately it ended, but our communication was so good that we have remained best friends since then and talk regularly about our new relationships. We both are huge advocates of each other - she sells me to other girls and I sell her to other guys. We do business together too since there is such a high level of trust.<p>2006 girlfriend: Had a great time together, but we both knew it wouldn't work. We had great communication and though it was hard for me to let her go, I did and that really impressed her to the point where we have a similar high-trust, high-advocate relationship as with 2005 girlfriend.<p>2007 girlfriend: Ended about a week ago. So far so good. Very hard for both of us. But we've had good communication since and it is evolving well into a good friend relationship.<p>Note that these tips assume that you are only dating reasonably sane girls - with psycho chics this probably won't apply ;)<p>It's important to remember that going the charitable route is often harder in the short-term than the alternatives, but it's important to suck it up and have the kahoonas to do it right. Some guys may be tempted to not give her a clean break or feel they have to diminish her as a person to satisfy their own insecurities. DON'T DO IT! Seriously, it will hammer your karma and make life much more difficult for you in the long-term. To illustrate: 2006 girlfriend only dated me because of the good things 2005 girlfriend told her about how good our relationship and breakup was. The same with 2007 girlfriend. It's really the way to go if you can be respectful and honor them, because more often than not, they will return the sentiment.<p>(sorry for the length - it started as a comment, but turned into a full post - hopefully a few will find some value in it ;)<p>Update: I decided to make this a full-on post at: <a href=\"http://blog.nanobeepers.com/2007/04/05/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/\">http://blog.nanobeepers.com/2007/04/05/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/</a>", "id": 9440, "time": 1175814060, "type": "comment", "by": "mattjaynes"}

I was in school and my co-founder had a job at a small software company. Really we just had a cool idea and wanted to do it. When we found out about YC we thought it was \"perfect for us\". We spent a week or two struggling over answering question just right. We had no product, and had not yet considered some of the questions the application was asking. As you may guess we got an email from YC in late October saying: <p>---\n\" We're sorry to say that we can't accept your proposal for funding.\nPlease don't take it personally, because most of the proposals we\nrejected, we rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the\nquality of the applicants.  For example, we were very reluctant to\naccept proposals with only one founder, because we think starting\na startup is too much work for one person.  We also rejected a lot\nof proposals simply because we couldn't understand them, or didn't\nunderstand the problem domain well enough to judge them, or because\nthe project seemed too big to start on only three months of funding.<p>We realize this process is fraught with error. It's practically\ncertain that groups we rejected will go on to create successful\nstartups.  If you do, we'd appreciate it if you'd send us an email\nmaking fun of us; we want to learn from our mistakes.<p>Thanks\nY Combinator Staff\"\n---<p>We told ourselves that wasn't going to stop us.... but it sorta did for a while. I wasn't done with school, but was getting dream job offers, and my co-founder was enjoying his software development job. So we didn't do much for a few months. We just kept talking about our idea for Revvu.<p>In doing some soul searching though, I decided I had to turn down these job offers and stop wasting time in school. This is not the life I wanted. After talking to my co-founder we came to grips with the fact that... working regular jobs was the default. That was the easy way to go about life, but we wanted more than that. We are too creative and determined to be held back or stifled by the nuances of a \"job\". <p>In January I moved across the country to live with my co-founder and work full time on our project. Shortly after that we had a full business plan, and were testing our site in closed beta. As of this week we've launched publicly and are getting encouraging user feedback. <p>We are beginning to tap our network to find potential investors, so that we can grow the business significantly in the next 12 moths. <p>About a week ago my co-founder brought up YCombinator for the first time in months, and we decided to apply at the last minute. Not because we NEED the living expenses, we both have savings. Also, not because we need it to feel like we're doing something. We're already confident that we're doing something, and we'll peruse other sourced of funding if we don't get YC. We applied because we know we could benefit from the mentoring, the guidance, the connections, and i guess partially because not draining our bank accounts just to eat would be kinda nice.<p>If the author had good intentions, IMHO, we might be a model for what he was trying to communicate. We weren't ready before. We were sitting around waiting to hear back from YC in October, and nearly let our passion fade after not being accepted. <p>This time filling out the application didn't take long at all, because we actually knew our answers. This time we have a real plan for our business and legitimately strive towards success.<p>If we get YC... awesome, if not... thats fine too. <p>I hope many of you are in the same boat.

He couldn't remember the order of operations, so he was having trouble parsing the statement:<p>(forall x, y in Z)(x &gt;= y AND x &lt;= y ==&gt; x = y)<p>That led him to ask why should I not just include the unnecessary parens, i.e. ((x &gt;= y AND x &lt;= y) ==&gt; x = y), which then led to the question of where to stop adding parentheses.  Finally, he recalled talking to another professor who made the case that having rules for order of operations is a bad idea (because those rules have to be memorized), and why not just parenthesize everything?  I pointed out, of course, that he was almost exactly describing Lisp.<p>That thought, however, led me to consider the idea of making order of operations always evaluate left-to-right, except for parenthesized expressions, which would be evaluated first (in the same manner).  Leveraging this idea, perhaps it would be possible to escape the hold of exclusively using s-expressions?<p>My main goal would be to write a general-purpose language which could be used for writing <i>any other</i> language by using the macro facilities, instead of being forced to write Lisp-like languages as appears to be the case with Lisp.  Of course, maybe to get that general, you may as well simply use lex and yacc to write a compiler.<p>Well, anyways, these are mostly just ramblings, and I'm glad to see that others are interested in this idea.", "id": 9498, "time": 1175828920, "type": "comment", "by": "BrandonM"}

For the first 2-3 years, it was all part-time of 2-4 days a week but, for the past decade, it's been full-time. <p>I tell you - even 12 years on, it is still hard to do. I do a lot of traveling  as a consultant and trainer and these are usually Monday through Friday gigs. When I get back to the \"office\" and start to work again on Monday, I've totally lost the groove lol. That's it - it only takes a week of me getting out of the mindset of working at home to lose it. When I come back to the office on Monday, I want to read reddit, catch up on all the stuff I missed and I almost always find that Mondays have a lot of wasted time in them lol. <p>It took me probably 2-3 years initially to get the mindset down and learn how to separate work from play. Distractions are huge at home but, for a 20-something with no significant other, they are less so. Now, I have a spouse and a fun little three year old at home - those are more distracting than all the strip clubs and PS3s in the world lol. But you manage. <p>Last bit - I would suggest that, when you are looking for a spouse/significant other, make sure that person is okay with a comment like, \"Honey, I'm going into work now. I want you to think as though my office is 30 miles away from you and you can't just walk in and ask me a question. Send me an email or phone me if you have a question.

True, no product campaign these days is complete without a rebranding of the web itself. <p>As advertising has undergone a power shift, from the content providers to the users, advertising has somehow become a bad word. Now that end users decide what and how products will be pitched, advertising seems to stand not only for traditional, flashy, in-your-face ads, but for any product communication that has already occurred. In that sense,  advertising is perpetually over, and therefore always omnipresent.  <p>Simply put, as more and more people research products and services online, making purchasing decisions online, and actually buy online, it seems preposterous to claim that advertising, and companies that are in the business of advertising, are in anyway passe. It is inconsistent with the evolution of the web. <p>What I like about Komisar-backed Aggregate Knowledge is that it is creating the platform for some wonderful advertising streams. Right now, as I understand it, they are touting as part of their product targeting by the Psychology of Crowds, or the beginning of building psychological profiles of buyers. This is done on many shopping sites: If person 1 buys product A, then he will, based on group research, be interested in product B and product C and should be presented with B and C in a non-obtrusive fashion.  \nWhat this should naturally evolve into is a better targeting-being able to differentiate between types of buyers; is she an impulse buyer that might be wooed by a flashy interface, or is she a research shopper, who needs a case study to buy? Merely providing relevant content, without the proper packaging for the individual (what I think to be the advertising formerly know as advertising) is deficient.   \nAlso, what is the ideal interface complexity of this shopper? For instance, in person people buy less in big stores because they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of options. They are more likely to buy products in a smaller store. People are more influenced by items placed at the front of the store as their shopping goals are more malleable as they enter. Not to say that these findings will translate directly to shopping behavior on the web, but we will soon have the ability to create the perfect shopping environment for an individual, and advertising will be big part of it. \n", "id": 9670, "time": 1175886129, "type": "comment", "by": "rebecca_d"}

These transplanted stem cells will create HIV immune T cells. Once there are enough immune T cells, the patient will probably still have HIV, but it will not develop into AIDS.

This, in theory, will allow the mice to be infected with HIV since HIV attaches to the CCR 5 receptor to enter and infect the cell. If this works, we can then try the technique of taking some of their stem cells, introducing the mutation, transplanting them back in, and see if their T cell count increases or if the levels of HIV decrease.

The answer to these questions should be a single, simple, focused answer.<p>2. What is the absolute minimum feature set we must have in order for the product to do what the user needs?

See what the users like and dislike about the product, based on first hand observation. <p>More tricky is keeping the product simple in response to user feature demands.

The software my firm uses is Autodesk Revit's \"Building Information Modeling\", a highly evolved \"intelligent\" 3d modeling database system.  The software uses every byte of ram, every hz of cpu, every byte & hertz of video interface on a users system - it takes serious horsepower to run a large model which is accessed over the network by multiple users.  (Refreshing the model remotely via vpn over dsl can take 15 minutes)  I don't see AJAX coming close to handling this kind of load for a long while.  Also, the files can be huge, and in a web-hosted environment, the file storage would have to be absolutely massive and absolutely fast.<p>An interesting note is that Autodesk started out with Autocad, which they coded in lisp (eventually transformed into autolisp.)  They took the MS model to software development and proceeded to make bigger and more complex versions with increasing quantities of bugs to the extent that multiple crashes per day were the norm.  But they owned 80% of the world cad market, they became the 2nd largest software company in the world.<p>Revit was developed by a small company with an incredibly sound software architecture with a database at the core(without the massive bandaids that had piled up in Autocad and are still there today.) and developed a devoted cult following.  Autodesk fought back with \"Architectural Desktop\", which I bought (before I knew about Revit).  Their version:  Cut a section through a building, wait 30 minutes.  Revit, Cut a section through a building - instantly.  Autodesk got very scared, then bought Revit.  They saw the writing on the wall and undersood that Revit would be completely replacing Autocad in the next few years, which it is doing now.<p>So if MS can buy Google, they'll be all set :)", "id": 9904, "time": 1175922098, "type": "comment", "by": "gibsonf1"}

The idea was to develop a web based operating system for people that have never used or are uncomfortable with current computers. We had initially envisioned it as a product bundled with hardware but decided we would be unable to finance that, so we'd start with just the software.<p>Of course, the YCs immediately understood that the associated hardware was an important part. They suggested that a good starting point was an \"internet picture frame with email.\" Instead of going with their suggestion, we defended our own.<p>They also spent a lot of the interview comparing our product to yahoo.com which was another direction we didn't think the interview would go.<p>In the end, we were rejected because we didn't have a functioning demo. It was a dumb move on our part, and I would say a demo is an absolute must for the interview. I really regret making it as far as we did and not having a demo. We threw away our opportunity. I've heard that one demo-less team was told at their interview to make a demo in the next 24 hours, so be prepared for a serious test of your ability to get things done if you don't have a demo. Being undergrads didn't help us either. If you're an undergraduate, make it clear to the YCs that you are absolutely committed to starting a company and that you intend to drop out and work on it whether or not you get funding from them.<p>For me, it's all moot because I got myself banned from Y Combinator after I made a really dumb Techcrunch comment. I've burned my bridges, but at least Paul lets me post here. :) One of my partners that didn't go to the interview was reading one of Paul's Lisp books at the time and commented on how surreal it was to be blacklisted by the guy who wrote the book he was reading.<p>When I was younger, I always separated the internet and internet-based friends from the real world. They weren't the same. My internet persona and the real me were different. I've since come to understand that the internet now is the real world. The real world is the internet. My internet persona is me and actions in both worlds truly impact each other.<p>They also had really good drinks and cheese available. I could tell by the cheese labeled with the country of origin that Y Combinator was an amazing company. We waited in a coffee shop because we didn't want to be too early, but I wish we would have gone earlier so we could have talked to more people that were also interviewing.

{"parent": 9969, "text": "Wow, this is awesome. Unfortunately it will probably be a good wait before this is built and released to the public.<p>In the meantime, I've been developing a framework using EC2, S3, S3DFS (DFS = Distributed File System) along with SQLite to try and solve the database problem on AWS. <p>S3DFS allows you to mount an S3 bucket to one or multiple EC2 instances as if it were a local filesystem. It works at the block level and has read/write caching - so is very fast. (Note: It's free to use for development, but otherwise requires a paid commercial license.)<p>Since SQLite uses flat files and has no database server or client, it is ideal for use on S3. SQLite only scales well to a point, so to get around its limitations I am separating each user into their own database (each database is a separate flat file). This can sometimes be a bad idea, but SQLite allows you to attach multiple databases together to essentially create a temporary master database where you can run queries across all the user databases at once. This will be handy for search indexing, site-wide stats, etc. In order to change the user databases I will have utilities to allow global scheme alterations.<p>So, by adding EC2 instances that are all attached to the same S3 bucket, and using round-robin dns to distribute traffic among them, you can theoretically scale a web service infinitely. Just launch a new EC2 instance and add it to the round-robin dns pool and you're done! Even that could be automated to respond dynamically to traffic.<p>Imagine the long-term cost-savings from only having to build your app and architecture once and not having to go through a more complex scaling process like this: <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/21793/Scaling-PHPMySQL-Presentation-from-Flickr\">http://www.scribd.com/doc/21793/Scaling-PHPMySQL-Presentation-from-Flickr</a><p>Certainly you should only worry about scaling after your app is up and running, but what if you didn't have to ever worry about it?

In general, SBCL has come a long way, partly due to companies that use CL (e.g. ITA) funding its development. CL is in many ways much more production-ready than it used to be for that reason. It still has rough spots, but my experience is vastly improved over what it was 1.5 years ago. ", "id": 9995, "time": 1175944337, "type": "comment", "by": "ecuzzillo"}

{"parent": 9661, "text": "I think the article does a good job of conveying what Lisp is to someone who just can't get it.  I agree, however, that it is a bit on the verbose side.  I think that at least a third of the text could have been removed without taking out any content.  Heck, some of the content could have probably been removed without taking away from the point the author is trying to convey.<p>To make the analogy even more succinct, I will first ask you a different question.  Have you switched to Firefox?  It wasn't long ago that I went from using IE6 to using Firefox.  Before too long, between tabs, quick searches, customizable toolbars, incremental page search, and more, I found myself saying, \"Wow, this is what browsing should be.  How did I ever use IE?\"  Lisp is the same way.<p>I disagree with the article's conclusion, \"Learning Lisp is an uphill battle.\"  If you have a good reference, it is not hard to start programming in Lisp.  You could learn Lisp by writing trivial code in about the same amount of time it would take to learn C or Java.  In fact, your code would probably be structured in much the same way.  Once you've learned enough Lisp, however, and once you get to the chapter on macros (of whatever Lisp reference you're using), something will click.  Then you will realize that you have been programming all wrong all along, and you will instantly rewrite everything you've ever done in one red-eyed night.  The next morning, you will be reborn.<p>But seriously, if you really want to learn Lisp, drop the $40 (or whatever it costs at the moment) on <i>ANSI Common Lisp</i>; it's a great read.  Once you plow through that and are hungry for more, look for <i>On Lisp</i> or <i>Practical Common Lisp</i>; both of them are available online.<p>If it wasn't for my classes with their requirements to program in C++ or Java, I never would have looked back after learning Lisp.  I think any good programmer who gives Lisp an honest try will feel the same way.", "id": 10000, "time": 1175945037, "type": "comment", "by": "BrandonM"}
